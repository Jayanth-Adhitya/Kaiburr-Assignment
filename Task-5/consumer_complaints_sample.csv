Again I was told by the agent their is n't anything they can do. I asked for an email or address to the CEO or administrative offices that I could write a letter to and was told their was no email or address they could provide. I also told the representative today that I noticed that XXXX reports increase and decreases on my loan monthly to the credit bureaus that drastically affect my credit score. I asked the agent why are they reporting my loans like this especially considering they are in deferment. Her response was "" I do n't know '' ... well shoot I do n't know why either and we both ca n't not know why!!! At this point XXXX fraudulent and inaccurate reporting of my loans are causing me to experience difficulty acquiring credit. I would like for them to remove the loan and the late payments from my credit report completely.

Provide a verification or copy of any judgment if applicable ; Identify the original creditor ; Prove that the Statute of Limitations has not expired on this account. Show me that you are licensed to collect in my state. Provide us with your license numbers and Registered Agent.

I am writing to bring to your attention a matter that requires resolution. My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am a customer with the mortgage account associated with Loan Number XXXX. 
I recently sold my house for cash on XX/XX/XXXX, and I engaged the services of XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to handle the closing and payoff of my mortgage. However, as directed, XXXX XXXX did not pay the mortgage even after sending the residual to my account. I have bought and sold several properties and have never seen or heard of such a thing. 
I have attached a letter from XXXX stating a technical error. When he discovered nonpayment, he said the wire transfer for closing the account was bounced back to him. This incompetence and lack of checks and balances is disturbing. 
I had a XXXX representative contact me for the monthly mortgage payment. I informed them the house was sold, and they said they would put a note in the file. Upon the second contact from one of your representatives, they looked at the file, to our surprise, to find that the attorney had never paid off the mortgage, even after sending me the balance. 
I then contacted the attorney and my real estate agent to investigate the matter, and that is when I was told it was not their fault, which I did not believe. By that time, the mortgage was in the XXXX late range. I again contacted XXXX customer service. Your customer service representative, a professional and compassionate woman, explained the process. She said she would put an extensive note in my file and contact the correct department to stop the late report to the credit bureaus. She decided to go the extra mile for me because of our mutual love of animals. My beloved dog XXXX XXXX the Saturday after XXXX suddenly from a XXXX XXXX at XXXX years of age, and I was heartbroken and beat up with this and the ordeal with my mortgage. 
I hope you will consider the circumstances of a woman who, in all good faith, put her trust in someone who did not do the most essential part of their job to pay off the mortgage. None of these errors were my doing, and I had no control over these outrageous mistakes. I also hope you will see in your heart that I have not done anything wrong and that a XXXX late on my credit for XXXX years, at which time I will be XXXX years of age, is a high price to pay for my attorney 's mistakes. 
I kindly request your cooperation in removing my mortgage account 's negative late payment entry from my credit reports. I understand the importance of maintaining a positive credit history. I believe it is only fair that this late payment, which resulted from an attorney error while acting on my behalf, should not negatively impact my creditworthiness. 
I appreciate your understanding and attention to this matter. If you require any additional documentation or information, please do not hesitate to contact me at XXXX or XXXX. I look forward to your assistance in resolving this issue and appreciate your help in rectifying the situation.

After finally speaking to a XXXX rep who honestly told me I was just out of my 24 month contract terms on XX/XX/2019. Since I was moving at end of XXXX, I agreed to go ala carte, no contract for the next few weeks. My billing cycle was thru the XX/XX/XXXX, so I paid in advance thru this date and that is the time the services were scheduled to be cancelled. Since out of contract is at a higher rate, I eliminated many channels to manage my bill. I immediately returned their equipment. I called XXXX many times to insure my account would be closed at end of XXXX and that I had a XXXX balance and each time the XXXX rep confirmed this information ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ). I received many emails from them saying my account was closed, asking me to come back as a customer, offering me new deals ( I have the emails ). Two months later, XXXX sent me one bill with an early termination fee of {$130.00}. I had a credit balance of {$12.00}. I made several more calls to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and thought the situation was resolved. Another two months On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from a collection agency!!! The amount owed was {$100.00} so XXXX made some deductions. I put amount was put in dispute. I have superior credit, all my life. Immediately called XXXX, put the amount in dispute, spoke to XXXX, and he said that XXXX put me in a new contract without my consent. Agent agreed that I would not have entered a new contract for 2 weeks when I was moving. XXXX agent said he would speak to his supervisor and it would be resolved.

I've never had an account in collection in my life!! XXXX again!! Im currently looking into a loan and this will have a major negative impact.

2024-10-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,""" I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding unauthorized accounts that persist on my credit report despite my repeated efforts to have them removed. These accounts are causing significant damage to my financial reputation and overall well-being. It is evident that the inclusion of these fraudulent items violates 15 USC 1681b regarding permissible purposes, as the credit bureaus have no legitimate reason to report them without my explicit consent. Please refer to the attached file detailing these items I am disputing.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ) says ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. So whenever there is a violation under the FCRA, it impairs the efficiency of the banking system. This is a violation of my privacy with my consumer report, since I control what is listed and what is not. In the event that any accounts are reported without my written consent, that is considered identity theft.

As per the FCRA, the agency is obligated to notify the furnisher of the disputed information and provide them with all relevant documentation. However, they failed to fulfill this obligation, and as a result, the furnisher continued to report the inaccurate information without any verification or correction. I also requested identifying information in reference to any supporting documentation to sustain why the items Ive disputed are continuing to report. I received nothing.

In my previous complaint, I specifically requested identifying information and supporting documentation to justify why the disputed items are still being reported. To date, I have received no such documentation or any satisfactory explanation.

I also submitted the required form to FedLoan servicing to get the remaining balance forgiven XX/XX/2020. However, I am being told I have to wait *up to 6 months* for them and the dept of Ed to process my application for forgiveness. This is both unconsionable and in violation of the regulation 34 CFR 685.219 - Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. That regulation specifically states "" ( a ) General. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is intended to encourage individuals to enter and continue in full-time public service employment by forgiving the remaining balance of their Direct loans after they satisfy the public service and loan payment requirements of this section. '' It never says *anywhere* in the regulation, nor the statute, that I also have to wait up to 6 months for processing. On the contrary, it states it will forgive my remaining balance "" after [ I ] satisfy the ... requirements of the section '' and nowhere is there any additional requirement whatsoever about an extra 6 month wait after submitting the forgiveness form.

In accordance with 685.219 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( ii ) I must remain "" employed full-time by a public service organization ... - '' until my loan is forgiven. Therefore, adding an additional requirement to wait up to 180, not stated anywhere in the reg is a signficant legal error. And it means I have to stay employed in my current job an additional 6 months in order to obtain the benefits I was promised when I signed up for the public service loan forgiveness program. Nowhere anywhere was I warned about this additional, ( legally impermissible ) super-regulatory requirement.

I am requesting that you force FedLoan servicing to process their part of my loan forgiveness application *immediately*, in accordance with the regulation.

I understand the dept of Ed also has to process the application for the loan to be forgiven, and that they do this after FedLoan servicing finishes processing it. I know that the same standard applies to the dept of Ed as is stated in the regulation section I provided, so dept of Ed also needs to process this immediately. However, I do not believe you have any jurisdiction over the dept of Ed so I have raised that issue with my Senator in hopes they will respond favorably to him.",,AES/PHEAA,VA,226XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2020-10-10,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,3894310

You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not.

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not.

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",CA,90015,,Consent provided,Web,2020-05-26,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3669478

Way back XXXX 2012, while I was still a XXXX in a XXXX XXXX, I donated {$5.00} as a goodwill to a family in need using my Paypal Account. I have a debit card linked to my Paypal Account back then and did not realize that there is an opened XXXX/PAYPAL account and was linked to my Paypal Account. Confident that this {$5.00} was charged to my debit card, I did not realize that the actual {$5.00} was charged to the XXXX/PAYPAL smart connect card. As a result, I missed the payment. This {$5.00} was then transferred to XXXX XXXX collection department that had accumulated {$87.00} including the {$5.00} principal amount which I have already paid off. But before that, the account was then charged off. 

I was never notified about this {$5.00} charge. Ive never received any bills or statement by Synchrony back. I did not even notice that Synchrony credit card has been opened and I never receive any card nor activated one. If only I have been notified about {$5.00} would have been paid in a heartbeat. Even though I strongly believe that I am not liable for the accumulated fees I still paid off the amount charged to me. 

I have asked XXXX XXXX many times to consider my situation. I could never believe that a simple gesture of kindness would cost me dearly. I could not believe that I could suffer like this for wanting to help someone in need. 

I am requesting yet again for XXXX XXXX to please consider all facts and for this account to be removed from my credit report. I have been denied several loan applications due this issue.

So I waited till XXXX, and called again since the bonus is still not posted. Another agent said I need to wait 3 months after all the requirements are fulfilled. So I waited another month. Still nothing. This time, the agent told me they would research and send me a letter. I received the letter, which said I did not qualify because of my existing checking account. I believe it was very dishonest for Citi to do. First, they should not have sent me the ads if they know I did not qualify. Second, they knew I had an account and should have told me at my first contact. But instead, they told me to wait and held a large amount to them for zero interest for almost 6 months.

2024-01-19,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Report provided to employer without your written authorization,"As of XX/XX/, XXXX began billing me for an alleged student loan I, XXXX XXXX : Beneficiary allegedly owe. However me being the beneficiary it doesn't benefits me to repay an alleged loan. I am writing to address the matter of the student loan debt associated with my account. I am the beneficiary of the XXXX XXXX Living Trust, and repaying this student loan debt is not beneficial based on a careful consideration of various factors. 

Firstly, I would like to draw attention to the etymology of the word "" repayment, '' which implies paying again. As a beneficiary of a living trust, it is my understanding that repaying an alleged loan would mean paying twice, which does not align with the equitable principles that govern trust relationships. Everything is a trust. How? Because everything is an agreement and if anything has my name on it thats a legal title of my estate. Now lets look at the work credit which means trust. Now lets look at the word report which means property. My credit report is my trust report which is my property. 

Furthermore, the maxim of equity states that equity does not punish. Repaying an alleged loan, particularly one that may not be legally enforceable or valid, could be perceived as a form of punishment. Equity regards the beneficiary as the true owner, and the trustee is obligated to uphold their duties in settling the account. 

Considering the aforementioned principles, I kindly request the following actions : Account Review : I request a thorough review of the alleged student loan debt associated with my account in light of the trust relationship and equitable considerations. 

Account Settlement : If the debt is found to be valid and legally enforceable, I request clear instructions on settling the account. As the beneficiary, I trust that the trustee will uphold their duties to settle the account. 

Removal from Credit Reporting Agencies : I request the immediate removal of any adverse reporting related to this alleged debt from credit reporting agencies, as it is not beneficial to the beneficiary 's interests. You're furnishing this information to the credit reporting agencies which makes you the trustee. If you're not the trustee then you're a stranger. Its three parts to a trust. Trustee, settlor, and beneficiary. If you're not the trustee then you need to hand me my property back. 

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a fair and equitable resolution. If there are any specific procedures or documentation required to facilitate this process, please provide them at your earliest convenience.

I opened my savings account to transfer funds into it each Friday to have the funds available to pay miscellaneous tax bills ( vehicle tax, municipal sewer, etc. ). 

The savings account is subject to a monthly {$5.00} service fee, subject to a few conditions which cause the fee to be waived. XXXX of those conditions- as outlined to me when I opened the account- is to have {$25.00} in monthly transfers. My weekly transfers were approximately {$16.00} each, causing me to easily hit the {$25.00} threshold for the first few months the account existed. 

Beginning in XXXX of XXXX, my account began to be hit with monthly {$5.00} service fees. When I visited a Wells Fargo branch in XXXX to inquire as to the fees, the banker I spoke with expressed that she was under the impression that my account should not be accruing fees due to the additive total of the transfers. She called what I am assuming is Wells Fargo 's internal helpline, and was informed that the {$25.00} was no longer additive for the month, but that there now had to be at least XXXX transfer during a month that was greater than or equal to {$25.00}. 

The banker was very apologetic to me, stating that she would have still been under the impression that the fees were still calculated the way they had been previously had I not brought it to her attention. She kindly refunded the XXXX  months of fees that I had been assessed ( {$15.00} in total ) and offered to file a complaint on my behalf.

I have been actively disputing these inaccuracies with the credit bureaus, but they have failed to adequately investigate my claims or remove the incorrect information. In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I attached the PDF file below containing the list of items that have violated my federally protected consumer rights to privacy and confidentiality under 15 USC 1681. 

Credit Bureau stated everything was complete and accurate. But how is that possible if the open date, date of last activity and much more is incorrect. According to 15 USC 1681i ( 5 ), they are supposed to modify or delete accounts that aren't reporting correctly. 

15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( A ) ( 1 ) A person shall not furnish any information relating to a consumer to any consumer reporting agency if the person knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate. 

I also believe that the credit bureaus have violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by failing to : 1. Investigate my disputes in a timely and reasonable manner : The credit bureaus have not provided a clear explanation for their decision not to remove the inaccurate information, and I believe their investigation was inadequate. 

2. Furnish accurate information to creditors : The inaccurate information on my credit report is harming my ability to obtain credit and other financial services. 

XXXX. Follow the FCRA 's dispute resolution procedures : The credit bureaus have failed to comply with the timeframes and procedures outlined in the FCRA. 

I am requesting that the CFPB investigate my complaint and take the following actions : 1. Order the credit bureaus to remove the inaccurate information from my credit report.

As a consumer, I have no ability to manage, secure, or opt out of the system. 
Identity theft is a real problem and all to easy commit with limited knowledge of the victim. Steps have to be taken on the federal level to protect US citizens and consumers from Identity theft and misuse. As I see it, the following actions need to be taken : 1. Prohibit the social security number from being used as a means of identification. The SSN should be used only for the collection, assessment, and distribution of social security taxes only. The dependency on a "" secret number '' that is required for virtually every "" big ticket '' purchase to keep our identities safe is an exercise in foolishness.
2. Set up HIPAA-like protections on identity. Force modern encryption standards on all databases containing identifying data. Make it incumbent upon any agency that wants to collect and store such data to properly secure it so that breech of a database can do limited damage at most. Impose stiff mandatory fines upon any company that loses control of such data and force compensation to be paid to any possible victim.
3. Come up with a system where identity can only be verified with participation of the consumer. Possibly based on a XXXX platform. Thereby the user can explicitly control who has access to his/her identity and who does not.
With modern day encryption techniques and technology, this level of security is attainable. One of  the main duties of the Federal Government is to protect its citizens from harm.

The lender stated there was really no other help than possibly offering them a settlement to purchase home. As time went by I had to come up with money that I did not have and was loaned the money by a friend. First, I offered {$5200.00} what I thought was a good offer based on the information provided to me by XXXX XXXX, NC Property Tax assessed value of the mobile home. I faxed on XXXX XXXX, 2016 to my account rep. XXXX what was required a summary that the amount I offered was available in my account. After a couple of weeks the offer was declined. Next, I spoke to another representative with Di-Tech that gave me the answer of the settlement being declined. This representative stated that I needed to come up with 50 % of the balance owed which is {$10000.00} which my current representative XXXX never made me aware that I needed to start off with that amount. I have went back to the person that loaned me the money before to see if they could loan me another {$5200.00} and they did. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I faxed an account summary that showed I have the {$10000.00} available in my account. Now, Di-Tech has required that they send someone out to take photos of the home as they did prior for the first offer, but no one ever showed and one Di-Tech a manager said we could try to submit the settlement with out the pictures. Well, that did not work and now they are requiring the pictures for sure this time. They get a technician from XXXX XXXX to come out on XXXX XXXX, 2016 to take the pictures and the technician stated it would only take 1 day for the pictures to be uploaded. The week of XXXX XXXX I called my rep XXXX everyday and they did not get the pictures. My rep XXXX stated her supervisor said it will more than likely be Monday XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I called my representative XXXX and she stated they received the pictures of my home but I 'm missing XXXX thing the new bank summary with the {$10000.00} showing in my account. I have a fax memory transmission report ***Successful Tx Notice** from XXXX XXXX, 2016 that confirmed the fax went to its destination. Now, my representative XXXX says its going to take a few more days to get the fax because it does not come directly to them but to a different customer service building all together. I feel like I have been misinformed purposely to stall and prolong the settlement process and do n't think it is fair for the home owner to be dragged for months trying to conclude on this settlement process. I also am a victim of predatory lending from this same account that was at first owned by XXXX XXXX because I never saw the amortization schedule before signing the agreement and was not aware that an interest rate of 18.5 % was so high at the age of XXXX. I was not mailed the amortization schedule until a few years after I had lived in trailer. I have lived in this trailer for 15 years trying to maintain it and it has become overwhelming with all the repairs and maintenance to keep it up. I have paid over {$60000.00} in interest alone and did not know that I will only be paying on the principal after I have stayed in the home for 10 years. Please help! Please help!

These items appear to be unverifiable, inaccurate, and questionable. Your agency has failed to ensure the accuracy of the information as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports. This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report. 

Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) Treatment of Inaccurate or Unverifiable Information, you are required to promptly delete or modify any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable during a reinvestigation. If you are unable to provide me with verifiable proof of the accuracy of the disputed items within 15 days of your investigation, these accounts and the related information must be removed from my credit report. 

Additionally, under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), I do not recognize any of the alleged creditors or debt collectors. I have never entered into a valid contract with any of these entities, nor have I engaged in any transactions with them. As such, these accounts are fraudulent and may be the result of identity theft or other illegal activities. Attempting to enforce these fraudulent accounts is unlawful. I request that you expedite your investigation to prevent further harm, losses, or damages that I may suffer as a victim of identity theft. 

Moreover, under the Fair Credit Billing Act, my right to privacy has been violated, and this breach infringes upon my rights as outlined in The Privacy Act of 1974. Removing the inaccurate and fraudulent information from my credit report will help restore my privacy and prevent further violations.

2023-12-03,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"On a weekly basis, I consume routinely both political and financial news. Typically, it keeps me informed on what is going on in the world, but rarely do I see any true connection or impact to my own life. Recently, I did have such a connection. I read that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was working to eliminate 'junk fees '. Shortly thereafter, I noticed that I had made an inadvertent lapse on an American Express Hilton credit card that I use for daily expenses. I normally pay the charges in full each month, but I had paid the XXXX charges on the statement date ( XX/XX/2023 ) and the XXXX charges after the next payment due date ( XXXX date : XX/XX/2023 ; Paid date : XX/XX/2023 ). Therefore, I carried a balance of {$47.00} between the months probably from pending charges that cleared. As such, American Express Hilton charged me a {$5.00} late fee, {$32.00} in interest, and confiscated the reward points ( valued $ XXXX ) for the month. I can understand the late fee and the interest as they are proportional and calculated based off the cards use and balance. But the rewards points confiscation is unlimited in its cost to the consumer. If I had spent more, then the confiscation of rewards points would have been as high as my spending, not my late payment. I have never known another credit card to charge XXXX % in a month based on credit card use. Even if legal, this activity should be discontinued through the Consumer Financial Protection Board or Congresses action in support of them. 

I sent this to my congressional representatives for future consideration as well.

There was absolutely no credit information similar in any way to the financial/ credit reports of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX The financial institution, XXXX XXXX, provided to me the reasons why they were not agreeable to handling my proposed transaction.

None of these four reasons for credit denial listed by XXXX XXXX  are pieces of information on my "" disclosure report '' provided to me by XXXX XXXX or LexisNexis. After, in a mailed letter provided by XXXX XXXX, are adverse action factors and detailed "" scores '' entitled LexisNexis Risk View Optics Score, RiskView Credit Score, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but this is not a credit report, as no creditors or payment history details are listed.

They are not reporting any detailed credit behavior to me when requested, leading me to believe they are not a true credit reporting company, and that they are just regurgitating information from the REAL credit reporting agencies.

Capital One 's hold on my account was unjustifiable and I was not notified in any way that a change or hold was even placed on my account until I realized it was taking longer than usual to access the paid funds. 

On XX/XX/2022 My Capital One account had some fraudulent charges that are currently being investigated. A Credit of {$320.00} which gave me enough credit to start using my card again as I wait for my payment to through. 

on XX/XX/2022 the credit I was given and was given a few days earlier became available. I used my card a on a few small transactions and my card was deactivated and closed down. I called Capital One to understand what happened to my account in which they informed me they terminated my account. The rep I spoke with advised for me to payoff the {$770.00}. Capital One also charged me a late fee on my account and this did incur interest. She also advised after the payment posts, to call back to begin the investigation process as to where the error occurred. 

After this conversation, I called back on XX/XX/2022 after the payment was posted and I was transferred to the collections department. The rep could not assist in initiating an investigation. I requested to be transferred to a customer service rep who could initiate the investigation. All reps were uncooperative in initiating my request of this investigation into the closure of my account which is another violation.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,VA,22980,,Consent provided,Web,2022-07-23,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5802358

2022-04-18,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"My complaint is in regards to a check that was issued that was fraudulently cashed twice. 

I issued a check in the amount of {$97.00} dated XX/XX/2021 to my gardener, XXXX XXXX. This check was cashed on XX/XX/2021. It is check # XXXX. 

Then, a withdrawal was posted to my account on XX/XX/2021 for {$970.00}. The check # was also # XXXX. The date was changed to XX/XX/2021. The payee was written as XXXX XXXX. I do not know who this individual is. The signature was altered. 

It is very evident that this is fraudulent activity & I am unsure of why CitiBank is taking so long to resolve this issue. CitiBank made the mistake here by allowing a check to be cashed twice with different sums, different signatures, & different payees. Even though it is Citi Bank 's fault, they forced me to open a new bank account. If the mistake was made by the bank, why do I have to make a new account? I did it but it caused me great headache because I had to change the account with the services that I have been auto-paying. As of today, I have sent a few emails to the bank but they do not respond at all & they have not refunded the sum that they have mistakenly cashed.

Despite multiple checks on my account and follow-up calls with Citizens Bank on Thursday and Friday, there was no update. I was advised to contact the originator of the funds. 

On Friday, XXXX XXXX confirmed that the transfer was completed on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX. However, Citizens Bank indicated that they had not received the funds. I was then informed on Saturday that my account had been closed in XXXX, and as a result, any incoming funds were automatically rejected. 

I have two other active accounts with Citizens Bank, on Monday I was told the situation was being reviewed. After extended wait times and multiple transfers, on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, a gentleman stated that the funds were received, on XX/XX/XXXX. Citizens Bank had taken the amount of their fees that created the negative balance before they charged it off and then they placed my remaining balance on a twenty-day hold for verification, but did not try to contact me. I understand that procedures are necessary, but it seems unusual for an XXXX to take so long, especially given the use of FedACH or FedWIRE systems. I requested that the remaining funds be credited to one of my active accounts but was informed that this would be processed as a check refund, taking an additional fifteen business days. 

Given my long-standing relationship with Citizens Bank , I find this situation concerning. I have also experienced disruptions in our family life, due to the preventable delay, including internet and cell phone service disconnections, which are impacting my ability to manage daily expenses, responsibilities and seek contact with possible resources. 

I have been provided with Case # XXXX and have been advised to follow up. I request your assistance in expediting the resolution of this matter, including the potential reallocation of funds to one of my active accounts or prompt processing of the refund.

Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to address your ongoing violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by failing to remove inaccurate, unverifiable, and invalidated information from my consumer file. This letter serves as my final settlement offer before pursuing legal action, with the intention of resolving this matter amicably. If the following listed items, which are inaccurate, unverifiable, and invalidated, are not promptly deleted, I will proceed with legal action in accordance with the FCRA to seek relief and recover the full amount of monetary damages entitled to me under Section 616 and Section 617. Please consider this letter as evidence in any future litigation and as part of a formal complaint to the Federal Trade Commission if compliance with this settlement offer is not met.

I have become aware of your direct violation of the FCRA, as the unverified items listed below still persist on my credit report. According to the FCRA, it is mandatory for you to possess the original creditors ' documentation on file to verify the accuracy of the reported information. However, you have not provided me with any original documentation, including a consumer contract with my signature, as required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ). Additionally, you have failed to provide the method of verification as mandated by Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). Please note that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA, you are obligated to promptly delete any information that can not be verified. 

I am deeply disappointed to observe your agency 's disregard for the guidelines outlined by the FCRA, as evidenced by the numerous errors present on my credit report. Allow me to provide you with a brief summary of the Fair Credit Reporting Act : The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law governing the collection, reporting, and sharing of credit information about consumers. It establishes rules for obtaining, retaining, and sharing credit information, including provisions that protect consumer rights. 

A FCRA violation can occur when creditors provide inaccurate financial information to reporting agencies, when reporting agencies mix up individuals ' information due to similarities in names or social security numbers, or when agencies fail to handle disputes properly according to guidelines. 

As a consumer, I am entitled to the following rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act : The right to verify the accuracy of my credit report when it is required for employment purposes. 
The right to receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in credit applications or other transactions. 
The right to dispute and have the credit bureaus correct and delete incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable information in my report. 
The right to have outdated negative information removed after seven years ( in most cases ) or ten years in the case of bankruptcy. 
I demand the immediate deletion of the following items, as they are either inaccurate, unverifiable, or invalidated. I have also specified the desired outcome for each item due to your violation. These items have caused significant distress as I recently applied for extended credit and was denied based on your mistakes : Account involved in litigation "" an incorrect high balance, '' an inaccurate date of last activity, "" REAGED ACCOUNTS, '' "" Reinsertion WITHOUT PROPER NOTICE, '' an undated late pay, a charge-off listed as open, and a collection account with a limit.

Because, 94 transactions used by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of {$1.00}, {$2.00} and {$5.00}. I was asked did you make these transactions?

My bank sold out to PNC bank. PNC sent me new loan information changing my term without my permission from 60 Months to 72 months, they added 12 months to my note along with fees and late charges. 

I went to the local office at the beginning of XXXX and spent 3 hours in there providing my original loan docs, copies of everything I had, they could not help me, but started a complait internally that would be expeditted to resolve this. 

a few days later I was given a retail resolution manager ( XXXX XXXX ) assigned to my case that would research and resolve the issues. There were several phone calls and discussions, I was extreemly frustrated because she was not calling on set appointment times, or answering or returning my calls. While on hold with the bank, she called leaving me a message on my XXXX stating that they did there research, and looks like I had 6 extensions for 2 months each, so thats why the loan was extended, so have a great day, glad we could solve this for you, let us know if you need anything else! She came across very condensending. I continued to call, knowing that I never had 6 extensions, this was incorrect, she never called or answered agian, and finally I was transferred to another agent named XXXX. 

XXXX said all the right things, apologized for her counterpart, promised to work diligently and correct the situation. She said she needed a specific amount of time. I explained to her, I would not bother or call her and wait for the date she set to hear from her. When I did not hear from here I started calling. We spoke the week before XXXX, and she told me that she would call me Wednesday the XXXX of XXXX. She did not call that day, so I started calling her on Thursday and we connected. She explaned she did not have the info was sorry, and would be calling me the day she returned from XXXX XXXX. Monday the XXXXXX/XX/2022. I called her Monday to discuss the situation, and got her XXXX stating she was not returning till Tuesday the 4th. So I left a message for her to call when she got back going again. 

She did not call so I left a message on Wed, Thurs, and Friday. Monday I asked to speak to another agent, and he said she was trying to reach me. So I called back Tuesday she was still not available. Wednesday She called me. I explained that I was disappointed that she was not keeping her appointments but I appreciated her call and what was the resolution. 

She stated that on there system they have notes of me getting 6 - 2 month extensions. I told her that never happened. I was told specifically from the bank that anytime I got an extension, or modification to the loan it had to be signed. So I asked her to please provide my signed copies showing that I signed the extension. She said they do not have those, and they got rid of that during covid. So I said well XXXX extensions you guys are alleging are pre-covid. Please show me those. She said they can not get the records. I explained to her that if they can not show me proof that I did this, I want it removed and my original loan. 

She said she would request that I go to my original loan, but I would have a big balloon payment at the end because I still owe this new amount. I told her that is not resolving or fixing anything. I do not owe it. 

So we left it at that with her saying the computer says I owe it, and No records stating otherwise. 

This is a total scam! No way my truth in lending statement and loan can be arbitrarily changed to reflect a new amount, new terms, and add XXXX to my original loan. I do not know what to do, and will be getting counsel next. This is wrong on so many levels.

2020-06-12,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"To Whom It May Concern : I have attempted to rectify an issue with Shellpoint Mortgage where they inaccurately reported my mortgage payments for XXXX and XXXX to be late. 

After five months if contacting Shellpoint regarding the matter, my credit was updated to reflect no missed payments. 

However, Shellpoint failed to provide appropriate documentation to have a XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX to update my accounts to have my credit cards restored which was terminated or lowered due to the inaccurate report. 

I have filed a report with The CFPB nd XXXX  which got them to fix my credit, but that was half the battle. The second part s the appropriate documentation to submit to XXXX and XXXX XXXX to restore my outstanding credit. Please see attempts below to resolve with Shellpoint. 

Email to President XXXX XXXX and Compliance Manager XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : Good afternoon all, Under advisement from an attorney who advised me to allow more time for Shellpoint to respond with corrections from a simple mistake, but you guys have failed to do so. 

Before involving the legal system, I have been advised to take measured steps as required by law to resolve the issue with Shellpoint. 

I received a letter from Ms. XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, that still placed the blame on me, stating that if this happens again, Shellpoint will not be willing to take the necessary steps to correct the issue ( AGAIN, I HAD NO CONTROL OR FAULT IN A CODE THAT WAS PLACED IN YOUR SYSTEM ), and it also indicated that my account was late for XXXX. Again, one if those issues where I have no control in when Shellpoint sets up bi-weekly payments. 

I am currently working with XXXX XXXX, Human Relations/Fair Housing XXXX County in filing a complaint against Shellpoint Mortgage for failing to correct such a simple error and destroying my credit. 

I am also contacting a local advocate, XXXX XXXX, and her advocacy group called, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and plan to submit my evidence to the local media to investigate if there are others who are getting the same treatment from Shellpoint as myself. 

If the report to the XXXX, CFPB, multiple phone calls and emails to Shellpoint and Mr. XXXX, report to fair housing, negative reviews on social media, and potential media coverage, I will have made my case to secure legal and punitive actions against XXXX XXXX and Shellpoint Mortgage. 

Please respond to this email in a timely and appropriate manner. I received an email from Ms. XXXX regarding this issue. In the email from Ms. XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX, I rejected her findings in the letter, and she has failed to respond. 

Please see the attached letter from Ms. XXXX, and I will itemize below the changes to the letter that I requested. 

Ms. XXXX indicates the Following : "" Please take note that our transaction records indicate that the payment was rejected due to an error code of Customer Advised Not Authorized '' and should same error occur, fees will not be waived, and credit reporting will not be adjusted. '' -I XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX had no responsibility in the system being coded in that manner and I am requesting an investigation into how this happened. 

As of this correspondence, the account is past due XX/XX/XXXX for {$1000.00} -I XXXX XXXX is requesting that a new letter be drafted and this be removed as I indicated to Ms. XXXX that this is inaccurate information and requested that this be updated nor removed in a new letter. I feel that this was a smear still against the customer. I have to submit this information to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, which indicates that I am still delinquent in my responsibilities. Not sure if she is upset in correcting this issue or if she is upset for some other reason. Nonetheless, this was not necessary to be included in the letter. 

Ms. XXXX goes on to say : "" Although we apologize for any inconvenience. New Rez has determined there have been no errors in the servicing of this loan. You have a right to request documentation supporting this determination ''. 

-I XXXX XXXX would like to request any evidence that supports that Shellpoint Mortgage did not error in servicing the loan. I would also like evidence that I contacted Shellpoint to unauthorize the payments. Please provide any written or verbal communication from me to Shellpoint making the request, and any verbal or written communication from the employee who made the changes. 

Kind regards, XXXX XXXX XXXX Communication from Ms. XXXX to me and my response below on XX/XX/XXXX. Ms. XXXX has failed to respond to my request. The attachment is what she sent me and has been attached to the complaint.

This letter still lays the blame on the customer in the accusation that I contacted Shellpoint Mortgage to unauthorized the payment. It further states that if this happens again that Shellpoint will not update credit or remove NSF fee.

This is beyond my control and I will not accept this as an appropriate resolution to this matter. Furthermore, when I submit this to letter to both XXXX and XXXX, it indicates that I have failed to pay my mortgage for XXXX on time and making my account appear to not be in good standing as it always has been. 

In order to resolve this issue please update the letter to not indicate fault of the customer, that my account is in good standing and not late because I don't control when Shellpoint Mortgage set up the biweekly plan. This letter should also indicate that Shellpoint Mortgage will indeed work with the customer to resolve this issue in a timely manner should this occur again.

During the last month, I have been contacted on multiple occasions by different people from Network Capital, insisting that I need to refinance again because they got audited by the government, and because they failed to follow certain guidelines, the loan was kicked back to them.

I was told that the property would be foreclosed if I didn't agree with refinancing.

I purchased an item from Amazon and it was delivered on XX/XX/year>. Part of the payment for this item was from my rewards money ( {$11.00} ). On XX/XX/XXXX I returned this item. Until today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I still haven't received the refund of my reward money. I called Synchrony and I understand that they have escalated the matter. I am hoping they will solve this soon. 

What I'm actually complaining about is the fact that there is no transparency in showing us the detailed transactions of the reward money. On Synchrony website or phone app we can only see the balance. There's nowhere to see individual transactions. If I didn't monitor the balance, I wouldn't have found that the {$11.00} was never credited to my reward account. Because of this incident, now I am not sure if any of my previous refunds was ever credited to my reward account, and I can't even check if they were or weren't.

I was about to make a payment of {$110.00} and noticed it defaulted. That was a surprise because about a month ago, XX/XX/2018, my husband and I called Navient to make a payment. 
The rep ( I'll call her XXXX ) told us paying {$110.00} would put the account in good standing. 
The rep I spoke to on XX/XX/2018 ( I'll call her XXXX ), informed me saying "" Yes, it was in good standing ... for XX/XX/XXXX. '' In short, though XXXX told me the payment would be fine and my account wouldn't be in default ( we asked at least 3 times to be sure ), it went to XX/XX/XXXX. Three days later, explained XXXX, my account defaulted for nonpayment. I told XXXX that had I known this, I would've paid for both months. XXXX didn't look to see if the conversation I had with XXXX was documented, I asked and she didn't respond. The only solution XXXX gave was to put my account in deferment. I refused because I knew Navient would tack on the interest on the back end. 
With only that solution, I told XXXX I'll still make a payment. XXXX then stated, "" for the record XXXX XXXX will make a payment {$110.00}. XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX. '' I stated, "" no, for the record, this payment I make is for XX/XX/XXXX. '' I contacted Navient 's Customer Service Advocate, but I haven't heard from them. I received an email from Navient giving me alternative options if I'm having trouble paying. 
I know I've got to pay this loan back and I'm willing to do so, but I'm tired of Navient continually giving me a hard time. Whenever I speak to a Navient customer service rep, it's like they have several different departments because they seem to keep no documentation ( though I know they do ) of the previous conversation I had with one of their reps. I'm told one thing by Navient 's reps and believe everything to be fine, but when I see my account messed up, I'll call and it's like I might as well have called a different student loan servicing company.

I have had a PayPal account for 21 years, since XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I was notified that my account was suspended, and all my funds frozen for 180 days, according to PayPal, due to Acceptable Use Policy violation, whatever that means. At that time, I was informed that at the end of 180 days I would get instructions on how to transfer my money out of PayPal. I have filed a complaint with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to which PayPal has responded : PayPal will make any remaining funds available to me for withdrawal on or before XX/XX/XXXX, and PayPal will notify me of this via email. 
I logged in to my PayPal account on XX/XX/XXXX and found my balance ( {$270.00} ) was withdrawn by PayPal to zero, due to damages caused by Acceptable Use Policy violation damages. What damages?! I called PayPal and after a significant wait was promptly told by a representative that there was nothing she could do and when I requested to speak to her manager, she told me that the manager would tell me the same thing. When I insisted, she placed me on hold and never came back on the phone. I hung up after about 45 minutes of waiting. Customer service at PayPal is non-existent. 
The bottom line is that PayPal broke their promise and without notification or any legal judgement, PayPal has confiscated all my money. There was never any explanation on what the damages were, I was being charged for. After extensive research, it became apparent that PayPal has been using its policies to justify illegal and fraudulent practices of stealing money from its customers. A reasonable person may see when a breach of user policy may be used to prevent someone from using their service, but to take someones property without a court order or any legal process constitutes theft in any civilized society. No person in their right mind would knowingly do business with PayPal under these circumstances. There are thousands of complaints against PayPal and several class actions suits.

2023-06-24,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Struggling to pay your bill,Credit card company won't work with you while you're going through financial hardship,"XX/XX/XXXX RE : COLLECTIONS Wells Fargo Bank, NA ( WFB ), Acct XXXX XXXX, ( CFPB ) Cases, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX To whom this may concern, XX/XX/XXXX, the Covid-19 pandemic broke out and effected millions across the nation, which eventually created massive job losses, delayed unemployment benefits, delayed stimulus payments, delayed federal extensions, paused government and financial institutions to no fault of the consumer what so ever. XX/XX/XXXX, my federal extension was cut off without good reason by The State of Californias Employment Development Department ( EDD ). By doing so, it resulted in delinquent payments and destroyed my credit to no fault of mine. I have produced my past credit and current credit history, see ( EXHIBIT A, Pgs. 1-3 ). These exhibits clearly show previous years of good standing credit prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, then plummets drastically because of the delays mentioned above, which was beyond my control. 
Recently, after one year and nine months, questioning ( EDDs ) unforeseen adverse actions, XX/XX/XXXX, ( EDD ) miraculously released the missing federal extension payments, see ( EXHIBIT B, Pgs. 1-2 ). If ( EDD ) processed the extension timely, it would have prevented the delinquent payments. Now, I am faced with a bankruptcy for the first time at a cost to me, which is unacceptable, disturbing, and concerning for a matter I did not create. 
I also reached out to The Department of Financial Protection and Innovation ( DFPI ), Office of the Comptroller of Currency ( OCC ). I argued the same mentioned above, however, neither agency would engage. In my view, there are no laws or safeguards that would protect a consumer from an event that has never taken place before. Because of the pause, it created a massive financial disruption that nobody has ever encountered before. I strongly feel, I am one of thousands, perhaps millions of consumers that was dealt a brutal blow because of the circumstances mentioned above. 
Furthermore, I find it very disturbing, as of lately there is a record number of bankruptcies being reported by consumers and businesses of all kinds. Consumers were given stimulus checks and federal extensions as well as businesses and now the majority are failing because of the pause, which is disturbing and concerning. I strongly feel all financial institutions do understand what has taken place. In my view, these financial institutions are Steam Rolling consumers for financial gain by taking advantage of millions of consumers who have delinquent and defaulted loans, which was created by the unforeseen historic Covid-19 outbreak. 
These circumstances were way beyond the control of the consumer. ( WFB ) has failed to recognize the impact this matter has created and simply do not want to. I have found out through my time spent with this matter, all lenders I have had accounts with acted in the same manner and hid behind their terms and conditions, which are dated and do not apply to this unique circumstance. There is nothing in writing within ( WFB ) terms and conditions that would describe how ( WFB ) would operate during a complete government and financial institution shutdown, because that event has never happened before in history. 
Again, in my view, there are no laws or safe guards that would protect a consumer regarding this never seen before catastrophe. So, how is a consumer supposed to protect oneself with no laws or safe guards set in place? I strongly feel, the banking institutions are fully aware of what they are doing and nobody is talking about this. So, where does that leave the consumer against these financial giants with zero resources to protect oneself against their relentless pursuit to obtain payment? Most of the nation, including myself are now being heavily impacted three years later, as its all falling apart right in front of the nations eyes with still no solution or recourse, why not? 
Additionally, the fault and blame lead back to the unforeseen Covid-19 outbreak and ( EDD ) for their inexcusable adverse actions. ( EDD ) did the right thing by issuing the past due amount. ( WFB ) must and should do the same by absorbing the past due balance to extinguish this matter due to their inexcusable patterns of unethical business practices, which has gone unnoticed. 
Finally, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, from XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX, informing me of the acceleration to collect the past due amount, see ( EXHIBIT C ). I reached out to the firm and spoke with XXXX and was provided XXXX XXXX XXXX contact information. I will be forwarding XXXX XXXX this same information, so this matter can be expedited for closure. 
Lastly, I respectfully request the ( CFPB ) to re-investigate ( WFB ) for their adverse actions and patterns of unethical business practices, as I have only noted the obvious throughout my complaints. If this matter is not under the jurisdiction of the ( CFPB ), please provide the appropriate agency or agencies that may be of assistance. 
CONCLUSION I respectfully request ( WFB ) to absorb the outstanding debt and reverse any negative credit reporting.

Specifically, the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ) requires credit reporting agencies to block the reporting of any information that the consumer identifies as resulting from an alleged identity theft, within four business days of receiving proper documentation. Additionally, the FCBA ( 15 U.S.C. 1666 ) states that upon written notification of potential identity theft, creditors must cease collection activities and conduct a reasonable investigation within 30 days.

2 ) Under the FCBA, require XXXX to absolve me of any obligation for payments, fees, charges or debts related to the fraudulent accounts. 

3 ) Ensure correction of any inaccurate information arising from identity theft across all credit reporting agencies as mandated by the FCRA. 

I have enclosed copies of the identity theft affidavit and report I filed with the Federal Trade Commission and my local police department, verifying that I am a true victim. As an innocent party, I should not be penalized for fraudulent accounts opened illegally and through no fault of my own.

2021-02-11,Debt collection,Other debt,Attempts to collect debt not owed,Debt was result of identity theft,"In XXXX of XXXX I became aware that I was the victim of identity theft. I received an alert from XXXX that my credit score went significantly down. Around this time, I received two collection notices in the mail from National Credit Systems Inc. One was for an unpaid apartment rental in Michigan ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for {$4900.00} and the other was for a related security deposit company, Sure Deposit, for {$750.00}. After looking into it, I found out that someone had been renting an apartment using my personal information including name, date of birth, and social security number. Both of these collections appeared on my credit report. I later found out that my personal information was compromised as a result of the XXXX XXXX Data Breach. 

I originally tried twice to dispute the collections through XXXX and their fraud department, and each dispute was denied. I then placed a fraud alert on my credit. I have also frozen all of my credit profiles through XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. I then filed an identity theft report with the FTC. The FTC provided me with a list of steps I needed to then take which I completed, including filing a police report. 

I filed the police report in XXXX of XXXX when I was told by National Credit Systems Inc. that I needed one. Also in XXXX I submitted the following documents to National Credit Systems Inc : my police report, FTC report, two years worth of leases proving my actual residency ( not in Michigan ), a picture of my drivers license, an affidavit packet and a Notice to Furnishers of Information. I followed up by calling them in XXXX and they said that they investigated the situation but my dispute was once again denied because my information matched the information that the false renter had provided on her rental application. I have contacted the collection agency and the apartment complex multiple times and neither have provided me with any options on how to move forward and resolve the issue. A few weeks ago, I gathered all my documentation and then mailed them to both XXXX and XXXX in order for them to reach out to National Credit Systems Inc. to resolve the issue and remove the collections from my credit report. This included a cover letter, police report, updated FTC report, copy of my drivers license, copies of the collection notices, and a copy of 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I recently received my dispute results from XXXX, and it has been denied once again, even though I have provided the proper documentation multiple times to both the credit bureaus and the collection agency. National Credit Systems Inc. has been very uncooperative in resolving this issue and I am requesting your assistance in helping to remedy this situation.",,"National Credit Systems,Inc.",MA,02127,,Consent provided,Web,2021-02-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,,4134159

The letter or email states balances are to high on credit accounts, to many open accounts. 
I have never been late on any accounts, to any SYNCHRONY held accounts nor any other creditor. 
During this time due to covid some of my credit card balances have increased. 
However, I have not failed to make above minimum payment due on time. 
I am having an issue with ine account that is HOME CREDIT credit card. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, HOME CREDIT discontinued and closed all HONE CREDIT cards entirely for everyone. 
At that time I/WE were informed that the accounts would be serviced by XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to make a payment by the APP on my phone 1 day after recieved notice that the payment was rejected, I called and after 4 days finally spoke to customer service made payment by phone. Currently, I have 5 different companies attempting to collect payments for this account Home Credit, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXXXX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. I refused to pay until this is sorted out and I am sure what company is going to be the only company collecting this account. 4 of the 5 are reporting this 1 account as 4 different pass due accounts. I have filed account with the Pennsylvania AG consumer bureau about the HOME CREDIT account. 
This affected my credit score. However, what SYNCHRONY BANK is doing is affected my credit severely and in turn using the damage to my score to justify further closing additional accounts. Effectively, closing 1 account then saying the percentage if use to credit available is to high. Then the balance ratio increases so they use that to clise another then another etc.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,PA,150XX,,Consent provided,Web,2020-12-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3992159

I spoke with a manager at Transunion and he said there was nothing they could do. 
I spoke with XXXX and they said they do not report to credit agencies unless the payment is late. Again this is categorically unfair to me. My score is being docked for something beyond my control and I am doing everything in my power to retain a good credit score.

( a ) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. ( b ) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section ( 1 ) that the information may be a result of identity theft ; ( 2 ) that an identity theft report has been filed ; ( 3 ) that a block has been requested under this section ; and ( 4 ) of the effective dates of the block. ( c ) Authority to decline or rescind. ( 1 ) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that ( A ) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error ; ( B ) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block ; or ( C ) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. ( 2 ) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ) of this title. ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. ( d ) Exception for resellers. ( 1 ) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency ( A ) is a reseller ; ( B ) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection ( a ) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer ; and ( C ) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. ( 2 ) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if ( A ) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection ( a ) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft ; and ( B ) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. ( 3 ) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph ( 2 ), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. ( e ) Exception for verification companies.

I have proof of the upload of those exhibits, I also notified the credit card company that they had an extended warranty policy attached to the use of their credit card use by the consumer which I relied upon and thus used the credit card with confidence due to that feature. 
Credit card company provided a temporary credit and subsequently ruled in my favor with the right of the merchant to appeal their decision. I was notified that any documentation the merchant provided would be sent to me and that arbitration if required would take place The credit card company reversed the dispute initially in my favor stating only that they received documentation from the merchant. They did not provide copies of any documents they stated they would. They claim that I only uploaded 3 exhibits, although I have proof of the 13 uploads on their platform. 
Those so-called missing exhibits were critical in establishing my claim of damaged goods including the acknowledgment by the merchant of the poorly produced and defective product. 

The credit card company made a reversal of the dispute without considering the facts and without extending my right to appeal and view the documents submitted by the merchant.

2018-02-05,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Privacy issues,"Summary ( detailed notes below ) : XX/XX/2017 : I discovered that Bank of America issued a credit card to somebody I do not know and linked it to my account. The other person incurred roughly {$800.00} in charges that were tied to my account. BoA told me this was a case of credit card fraud and reversed the charges. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received an e-mail that the new credit card I requested was on the way. I had not requested a new card. The e-mail stated the card was being mailed to the same address as the previous card. A supervisor first told me BoA never sent me this e-mail and it was a phishing scam. After proving ( with a XXXX tracking number ) that the bank did send me this e-mail and was mailing out another card, I was again told this was a case of fraud. I was advised to call the police in XXXX, Illinois, where the cards were being sent, and ask them to investigate. After I called the police, BoA then called me back to tell me it was actually their mistake and they had issued a card to someone with the same name as me. They assured me the issue was resolved. 

At this point, my banking information had been shared with a stranger, and I was given access to all of that person 's credit card purchases, phone numbers, e-mail address, and mailing address. I also requested confirmation that the other person involved be given a thorough and accurate information that this happened. 

I asked to speak with someone who could explain how this had happened. In numerous phone calls, I was passed from department to department. Nobody at the bank has been willing to give clear answers to my questions. On one occasion, a supervisor told me someone from their digital services department had attempted to call me and had left a voicemail. She verified the number to which this supposed call was made was my number. I never received this supposed voicemail ; furthermore, according to my phone company records, there were no incoming calls made to my number on the date and time BoA claims it called me. After going through these records, the supervisor who insisted someone had tried to call me changed her story and said she could not understand his notes and wasn't sure whether he called or not. She assured me that the issue of mistaken identity had been resolved. When I asked how the bank could issue a credit card without cross-referencing a social security number, she referred me to another department, which has failed to follow up. 

XX/XX/XXXX : After being assured this case had been adequately handled, I discovered that for the third time, a stranger 's phone number and e-mail address had been added to my account. 

In follow-up calls to BoA, supervisors have been dismissive, constantly passing me off to other people in other departments. I have asked for a detailed explanation as to how this happened and what specific steps they had taken to ensure this will not happen again. They have not answered my questions other than to say, "" Oops, we had a computer glitch! '' In XX/XX/XXXX, a BoA supervisor recommended, before it was discovered this was the bank 's error, that I sign up for two years of credit monitoring. Bank of America has now acknowledged this was the bank 's fault. I am requesting they pay for this service, and also provide me with thorough information on how this happened, what information the other party involved ( the credit card recipient ) has received ( as it is important he knows a stranger was given detailed access to his financial information ), and what specific steps they have taken to ensure this will not happen again. I find it particularly disturbing that I was reassured on multiple occasions that the situation was resolved, only to see it happen again a few weeks later. 

I feel Bank of America has been negligent in its handling of my personal information, and dismissive in responding to my requests for information. I have had to repeat this entire, very long story multiple times to new supervisors because each time I speak with somebody, they do not follow up, and the bank has told me it is not possible for me to speak with the people I have spoken with about this previously.

I signed up for their program on XX/XX/XXXX and have been doing everything they advise on their welcome packet and their client website. 
As a result of that, on XX/XX/XXXX I have been sued for 2 accounts and I have the following issues.

1 ) The company promised to negotiate settlements with creditors, but the service actually required the consumer settle their own debts. In this case, I have received a notice of default from one of the lawsuits, which basically means that they have done nothing. 
It misled its customers regarding the fees they charge. The company made consumers believe they only had to pay a fee when the debt got settled. The way it works, is that they send the first check for {$25.00} and they take all their fees after that. They do not disclose this on any of their documents. I found that out by looking at the ledger, I do see other fees that don't know what they are for. 
It misled its customers regarding the extent of its services. They tell you not to answer to the lawsuit or legal documents, instead, upload everything to their website as they pass the information to their partner network. There's a disconnect there, because they have done nothing and now I'm facing an affidavit of default where I have 10 days to respond. 

Also, Freedom Debt Relief has failed to notify its customers that some of the creditors hired to settle debts with had previously refused to negotiate to settle debts with third parties even when I called numerous times to get status on my case, no one knows anything and just tell me to call next week.

There was XXXX company names that have tried to withdrawl ACH debits out of my account doing multiple times with less and less amounts at least 3 times in one day upto 8 times in one day. Each time I found out, I have called the Navy Federal Credit Union and they tell me to send in the request form to receive the return item fee charges that they have charged me each time it occurred. In the last 3 months, I have been charged {$550.00} in return items costs. I have faxed in the forms, and they tell me they did n't receive them. I went into the branch on XXXX XXXX, 2015 and they filled out XXXX forms for the charges and turned them into the deptartment that handles that amount.

I then requested the reason for denying me in writing and they have refused. I went into the Branch again on Tuesday XXXX XXXX, 2015 and spoke with the Branch manager, XXXX XXXX at the XXXX, VA XXXX and when I requested again in wrting for the refusal to refund me the fees that they took from my account for a fraudulant company trying to ACH debit my account repeatedly after I had made numerous calls and attmepts to stop this, she said they were still researching it and it would take upto 3 weeks, if they determine to give me the fees back. I requested the elecutronic transmisions from all the attempts made on my account and she told me that there is n't anything to give me. When I told her that they needed to abide by the Regulation E. Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and return the fees to me, because I never authoized that company ( s ) to debit my account, she told me that the law did n't protect consumers against the fees incurred by the fraudulent attempts on my accout.

The information in question is a charge-off reported by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX 

This charge-off is inaccurately reported because the status update and the status of the charge-off do not correspond and are contradictory.

This inconsistency violates the FCRAs requirement for accurate and non-misleading reporting ( 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ). It is essential that the status of the account is reported accurately and consistently. 

The details of the inaccurate charge-off are as follows : Creditor : XXXX XXXX  XXXX Date of Charge-Off : XX/XX/XXXX Status Update : XX/XX/XXXX Dispute Reason : Account Information Incorrect Attached, please find copies of relevant documentation supporting my claim. According to the FCRA, you have 30 days to complete this investigation and provide me with the results ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ). If the account can not be verified within this period, the account must be completely removed from my credit report as required by the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ).

2019-07-24,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"This complaint is about the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program. I graduated with my XXXX in XXXX XXXX in XXXX. For five years after I graduated my loan was managed by Sallie Mae ( XXXX ), then by Navient ( XXXX ). 

Starting on XX/XX/XXXX, I was hired by the State of Maryland Department of Health. I have been employed there full-time ( 40-45 hours per week ) ever since. After I started this job, I reached out to Sallie Mae to inquire about the PSLF program. I was told during a phone call to make sure I was paying on time with an Income-Based Repayment Plan ; then after 10 years of qualifying payments, I could apply for forgiveness. Thinking I needed no further action, I continued making payments through my Income-Based Repayment Plan. 

In XXXX my loan was transferred to Navient ( not my choice ; Sallie Mae transferred the loan ). I reached out to Navient through multiple phone calls throughout XXXX and XXXX to confirm I was still in the PSLF program. I was told, by multiple operators in numerous phone calls, that I qualified for PSLF. I was told, again and again, that I only needed to ensure I was making on time payments with an Income-Based Repayment plan. I re-applied, and was approved for, an Income-Based Repayment Plan every year from XXXX through the present day. I was told, again and again, that after 10 years of qualifying payments, I could simply apply for forgiveness. I trusted Navient and Sallie Mae, and thinking no further action was required, I simply continued to make payments to my loan. I was never told to fill out an application to get my employer approved by PSLF. I did not think to record these phone calls because it never occurred to me that I was being lied to. 

In early XXXX I happened across an article in the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX describing the PSLF program. It was only through this article that I learned my payments did not qualify for PSLF. The article described that loans had to be consolidated ( mine were not ) and they must be held by XXXX only. I immediately began the process of consolidation and transferring to XXXX, which took several months. On XX/XX/XXXX I was approved for PSLF through XXXX. Since then, I have continued to make on time payments through an Income Driven Repayment Plan. I now receive letters confirming my placement in PSLF and confirming the number of qualifying payments I've made. Per the recommendation of XXXX, I re-apply for PSLF every year to get my employer approved. 

My complaint is that for nearly four years ( between XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ) I was employed by a state government, making monthly payments, and believing I was already part of PSLF. I make significantly less money in the public sector than I could in a private job, and the Income-Based payments I make do not even cover my interest amount. During those four years, my loan balance grew. It currently lies at over {$270000.00}. 

I believe those four years of payments should count toward my completion of PSLF. I am a cautious person, and I made repeated efforts to communicate with Sallie Mae and with Navient about my loan. I was directly given false information. Had a single person at either of those lenders told me to consolidate through XXXX, I could have done so immediately. Instead, I kept my loan at Navient, believing I was already part of the PSLF program. 

Because of the lies I was told, repeatedly, I now have almost 8 years remaining on my PSLF plan. If I had been told the truth, I would have less than 4 years remaining. These years, and these payments, make a huge difference in my daily life. I am a married mother to a toddler in full-time daycare. I have another child on the way. I am a homeowner with mortgage payments. This is a time in my life I'm trying to settle down, establish my home, and start my family. Four additional years of payments ( currently at {$1100.00} a month ) is a huge financial stressor for me. The lies I was told by Navient have had a lasting impact on my life.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",MD,20876,,Consent provided,Web,2019-07-24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3316654

It seems unbelievable to have engaged a scenario, where I encountered invalid, inaccurate, and false information on my credit report, and proceeded in a proper manner to take the justified measures to have it resolved ; contacting the Credit Bureau, with direct, clear, insightful evidence that proves the inaccuracy and falsehood that lives on my credit account. In my reality, what is to be unbelievable, is how this case, where I discovered and disputed information that was found to be damaging, with evidence against it, received a response from this said giant, this corporation, that delivered their stance at the disregard of the evidence that invalidated the inaccurate fields that they hosted on my account and its invalid account standing. The official response was to proceed in up hosting and upkeeping the false, harmful, and inaccurate data that the evidence clarified discrepancy against, but one. At this response, it was where all sense of voice, protection, righteousness, safety, and foundation that I believed a human held, and I as a genuine victim, held, was removed.

Its conclusion is one that is still affecting me today, internally. It is one that made me experience a sense of reality that held no righteousness, honesty, truth, morality, or level of safety. Encountering a corporation that nefariously felt too large to go against, yet, in an infrastructure that my heart knew to be democratic and American.

They in turn go through repossession, and resale of vehicle, before 90 days stated by repossession company, to re obtain vehicle if able to return to work. 
I then get letter stating the amount owed after sale. few weeks later collection letters arrive for more that first letter, almost double the amount. Then i get letters from a 3rd party collection agency for almost triple the amount owed. followed by letter delivered by a sheriff to my XXXX year old son for yet a different amount, almost triple. 
the dealer and loan company are both well aware of me having a XXXX and out of work since XX/XX/2014. and continue to harass with letters, threats and abuse since monthly. 
also on my credit report the loan was closed on XX/XX/2014, around the same time of resold. the vehicle was taken around mid XXXX. by the way completely different than the amount on letter, and sherifff documents sent to me.

I already refinanced several times and because of refinance costs I owe more than I did when I took out the mortgage over 20 years ago. They are stealing from me and draining me of all my money, then all they want is more. More more more more more money, constantly trying to hard sell me on the phone. THIS NEEDS TO STOP. STOP TRYING TO SELL ME MORE MONEY! STOP MARKETING TO ME, STOP THE PUSHY SALES TACTICS EVERY TIME I CALL FOR A MERE QUESTION!!! Today I was assaulted once again during a call to find out why my payment went up {$50.00} per month, the woman on the phone kept insisting I needed another refinance. This is evil, pure evil. She refused to take NO for an answer. I was forced to hang up on her because she refused to let me go!

I was contacted about a past due debt on XX/XX/19 and was advised that I was roughly one month past due in the about of {$130.00}. I advised that I would make a payment on Friday, but I would like for my grandmother 's number removed from the account due to her being elderly. I also was trying to explain at one point I was told that she would be removed as a co-signer. The representative did not want to listen to me so I requested to speak to a manager. It took 4 times for me to constantly state that I wanted to speak to be transferred to a Supervisor who was just as rude as the representative. Her ID is XXXX and located in Indiana site. She was trying to over talk me as I was trying to explain to her what I was told perviously about removing the phone number. She also belittled me and told me if I paid my bills on time they wouldn't have to contact her in the first place, isn't this a violation of UDAAP. I am currently recovering from XXXX so most of my funds are going toward my current situation. She also told me that there are guidelines that must be met before I can qualify for co-signed removal after degrading me and questioning me about my payment not being up to date. If I am only 1 month past due on my loan repayment and being treated this way, I can only imagine the obscene behavior they are displaying towards individuals that are more delinquent then me. I advised her that I would make payment on this upcoming Friday then she stopped attempting to belittle me, this is not customer service. I also requested that the pull calls from earlier this year when someone told me that the co-signer number would be removed. She advised that if I did not have an exact date they were not going to look through my account to find out when someone told me this after I requested this be done.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",IL,60707,Older American,Consent provided,Web,2019-09-11,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3370903

They gave me back a payment by check instead of a credit to the account and sent the extra payment to me in the mail. this extra payment was coded on my comenity account as a charge that I made and ever since they have been charging me interest on an account that was to be interest free for 48 months. Every month I have to call in to get the finance charges credited back and some of the representatives are giving me a hard time and trying to explain to me why I am being charged. Some of them have been argumentative and simply rude. I have been hung up on. I have requested a dispute but nothing was done at the end of the 30 days. I have asked several times if someone from management can call me back and that has never happened. They are refusing to allow me to speak with someone higher up to resolve my issues. They indicate that notes are being made with requests for someone to give me a call but no one has ever contacted me and I have had this account since XXXX. A few months ago there were a couple of charges added to the account and when I ask what they were for no one can explain to me what the charges are for. I only made one purchase with this account and nothing else. I need someone to assist me because the charges that were added to the account I believe need to be credited back. It was an error on comenity 's part and I have been dealing with it since XXXX or early XXXX and there have been several representatives who have assured me that they took care of the issue but every single month I am dealing with it. It has been an absolute nightmare. Please help me.,,"Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.",MI,48221,,Consent provided,Web,2024-11-01,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,10653605

2024-02-11,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am writing this complaint and submitting documents for evidence in a final attempt to have my right to privacy respected and my right to an accurate credit report pursuant to 15 USC1681. I have disputed many inaccuracies with Experian, XXXX and XXXX, and regardless of the dispute and documentation provided to prove my claim, all three CRA 's have not proven to have adopted reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information. 15 U.S. Code 1681- Congressional findings and statement of purpose ( a ) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting The Congress makes the following findings : ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. ( 2 ) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers. ( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers. ( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. ( b ) Reasonable procedures It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter. In the US Code copied above Congress is very clear in noting that the procedures used by any and all credit reporting agencies are the be fair and equitable to the CONSUMER, me, XXXX XXXX, who they are making the report about. There is nothing fair about constantly battling corporations over incorrect, inaccurate none validated data. The use of these elaborate mechanism have failed me gravely and I will explain that in detail below. Congress is also very clear that these corporations and financial institutions are to respect the CONSUMERS right to PRIVACY first and foremost, more than anything. Experian has violated my right to privacy, completely tarnished my credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, my character and credit reputation with continued negligence.

Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) Reinvestigations of disputed information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation required ( A ) In general Subject to subsection ( f ) and except as provided in subsection ( g ) if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer reporting agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, the agency shall, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Congress is very clear in this subchapter that a reinvestigation is required should a consumer disputes the completeness and accuracy of any item of information contained in the consumer 's file. A reinvestigation can only take place once an initial investigation has been completed. Congress is clear in defining in this subchapter that it is the duty and grave responsibility of the CRA 's to investigate any all items reporting to a consumer 's file BEFORE placing the data on there. Once the data is placed on the report and examined by the consumer and the consumer disputes the accuracy of the information, a reinvestigation is commenced. It is clear that Experian, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX are not conducting reasonable investigations to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate. The details below will list the inaccuracies and incompleteness and documentation evidence will be provided to support. 


Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( 4 ) Consideration of consumer information In conducting any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ) with respect to disputed information in the file of any consumer, the consumer reporting agency shall review and consider all relevant information submitted by the consumer in the period described in paragraph ( 1 ) ( A ) with respect to such disputed information.

Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( 5 ) Treatment of inaccurate or unverifiable information ( A ) In general If, after any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ) of any information disputed by a consumer, an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall ( i ) promptly delete that item of information from the file of the consumer, or modify that item of information, as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation ; and ( ii ) promptly notify the furnisher of that information that the information has been modified or deleted from the file of the consumer. 

Over the course of XXXX XXXX years I made several disputes with all three CRA 's Experian XXXX XXXX and XXXX to have this information properly investigated to that consumer file can reflect a true recording of my credit worthiness, credit standing and credit capacity. Despite providing documentation pulled directly from their websites or sent via the mails, containing clear inaccuracies and incompleteness with account data, payment histories, and account histories reporting for multiple items on my consumer report, all three CRA 's have been negligence in promptly deleting information that is inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified. Congress is clear that every consumer reporting agency must review and consider all relevant information submitted by the consumer. I don't know how much more relevant I can get in my documentation when I providing up to date copies of consumer reports and dispute results which is what is displaying the information that needs to be disputed. If the procedures used by XXXX, Experian, and XXXX were reasonable, fair and equitable to the consumer a deletion should have taken place XXXX years ago for most of the account information reflecting any incompleteness and inaccuracies. 

Pursuant to 15 U.S. Code 1681i - Procedure in case of disputed accuracy ( a ) Reinvestigations of disputed information ( 6 ) Notice of results of reinvestigation ( B ) Contents ( iii ) a notice that, if requested by the consumer, a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information shall be provided to the consumer by the agency, including the business name and address of any furnisher of information contacted in connection with such information and the telephone number of such furnisher, if reasonably available ; In every dispute before submitting the dispute I make my request knowing to each consumer reporting agency that I am requesting a description of the procedure used to determine the accuracy and completeness of the information. I have yet to receive any documentation of the procedures used. Each dispute I only get investigation result containing the same inaccuracies disputed with no deletion. Having to fight with XXXX dollar corporations repeatedly to protect my reputation has been mentally damaging. The negligence and defamation committed by Experian, XXXX, and XXXX has caused and extensive amount of actual damages to both me and my children. 

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is making a report to my XXXX consumer report with an open date of XXXX and close date of XXXX. The account information reads last payment made on XXXX, but doesn't reflect late until XX/XX/XXXX. Pursuant to IRS Publication 4681, the IRS treat charge offs like income and income is not reported on a consumer report. According to the payment history XXXX can't be the date of the last payment since XXXX reported an OK reporting for both XXXX and XXXX of XXXX. There is not amount paid reporting for XX/XX/XXXX to reflect the "" last payment made. '' The payment history for this account reads XXXX - XXXX XXXX OK, XXXX XXXX- 30 days late, XXXX XXXX XXXX OK, XXXX XXXX 30 days late, XXXX XXXX9- 60 days late, XXXX XXXX 90 days late, XXXX XXXX XXXX unknown, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX C/O. This payment reflects and incomplete and inaccurate payment history. This payment history jumps from 90 days late to XXXX months of unknown reporting then reports C/O for the next 38 months. This incomplete and inaccurate information was recently disputed under XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX certifies that this information is accurate. 

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is reporting to my Experian consumer report with an open date of XXXX, account is charged off and pursuant to IRS Publication 4681, charge off are to be treated and income and income is not reported on a consumer report. This account list a last payment date of XXXX which is only 6 days after Experian is reporting that the account opened, however the payment history reports payments received for five more months after this date. The payment history for this account reads XXXX & XXXX XXXX current, XXXX XXXX- 30 days late, XXXX XXXX XXXX current, XXXXXXXX XXXX- 30 days late, XXXX XXXX- 60 days late, XXXXXXXX XXXX 90 days late, XXXX XXXX XXXX No Data Reporting, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX C/O. The payment history for this account reflects 6 months of positive payments but account info section last payment received in the same month the account opened XX/XX/XXXX. The payment history jumps from reporting data to making no report for several months. This information is incomplete and inaccurate and needs to be promptly deleted. 

XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX is making a report to my XXXX consumer report with an open date of XXXX and delinquency first reported date of XX/XX/XXXX. The payment history for this account reads, XXXX XXXX No Data Available, XXXX XXXX- 60 days late, XXXX XXXX No Data Available, XXXX XXXX- 60 days late, XXXX XXXX- 90 days late, XXXX XXXX 120 days late, XXXX XXXX No Data Available, XXXX XXXX XXXX C/O. How does the delinquency first day read XX/XX/XXXX but the payment history is reporting 60 days late in XX/XX/XXXX. Date of late payment reporting XX/XX/XXXX but payment history doesn't reflect that payment and is not reporting any data for this period. This account payment history is jumping from no data available to 60 days late. All of this inaccurate and incomplete information was recently disputed but Experian certifies that the information is accurate. Well unless I'm XXXX you definitely have to be 30 days late before you can be 60 days late and making reports only some months is incompleteness. This account needs to be promptly deleted from the consumer file.

2023-06-12,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification from my credit monitoring service that my BPOP credit card was in settled status. I had no idea what it meant and I was slowly paying off their credit card. Once I learned its a negative status I called BPOP at XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, where I was told that the account is closed and that I should call XXXX. Note, on the website the account still shows as open and active. 

I called XXXX and eventually talked to a supervisor XXXX, who said a notice to me they have a record of a notice being sent and that account was closed a year ago. I never received that notification so I am not even sure if I was paying on a closed account all that time, but the settlement notification did not show up on my report until XX/XX/XXXX. I never received a letter or a call from anyone so I could not even attempt to resolve this item going into 'settled ' status by simply paying it off. I certainly did not know the account was closed for that long. 

When I pointed it out XXXX said there is nothing they could do and gave me a phone number to another 3rd party ( XXXX ). I did indicate that she is forcing me to call multiple agencies and whether there is really nothing else, they can do. She said no. 

To add additional wrinkle to all this, after a call got disconnected, I called back to get the remaining details on the account ( date closed, amount owed and date the notice was sent ). A different representative ( not XXXX ) indicated that the account was closed XX/XX/XXXX, amount owed was {$1400.00} and notice was sent XX/XX/XXXX. Needless to say, I noted the discrepancy in dates ( recent closure and notice ) provided by XXXX and requested to speak with XXXX again, but she was in a meeting already according to the representative I was talking at the time ( XXXX XXXX ). 

Something clearly went wrong, but I am not even sure what or who is to be blamed for this issue. More annoyingly, no one seems to know exactly what happened. I keep getting a run around and the information provided by different representatives is contradictory so I am not even sure who to trust in terms of information. All I know for sure is : I got a ding on my credit report and it was a surprise, because the amount I thought was a balance on credit card is now a 'settled ' balance.

I was paying off the full balance in the month of XX/XX/XXXX so using the BofA website I changed the automatic payment to equal the account balance, which at that time was {$14000.00}. The confirmation stated the {$14000.00} payment was scheduled to be made on XX/XX/2019 from my checking account which was linked to the Credit Card bill pay account. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I noticed the automatic payment system withdrew {$290.00} from my checking account ( this must have been the original minimum payment ) so my balance was now {$14000.00}. On evening of XX/XX/XXXX I checked the system to see if the next scheduled payment had been adjusted to match the new balance due, but it was still showing {$14000.00}. The payment webpage had a "" change payment amount '' link so I used that link to change the {$14000.00} payment authorization to {$14000.00}. The system acknowledgment indicate the change was accepted. 
Then on XX/XX/2019 I checked my Credit Union account and saw that BofA had in fact made a withdrawal in the amount of {$14000.00} and a second withdrawal of {$14000.00} for a total of {$29000.00} which overpaid themselves by {$14000.00}. I did not authorize payments of {$29000.00} and their system did not indicate it was going to withdraw that amount either. I contacted BofA on XX/XX/2019 to inform them of their error and requested they return the {$14000.00} overpayment to my Credit Union Checking account. They apologized for what happened but could not explain what happened. They said they would reverse the charge but it would take 2-5 business days for the money to be returned my account. The 2-5 days time has elapsed and I still have not had my money returned. In the meantime I do not have access to my money. This should not have happened, $ XXXX is a lot of money for them to have taken without authorization. I need the money returned ASAP and since it has taken more than a week I also think they should owe some sort of penalty, XXXX knows they would charge me a lot if it was me that had made a payment mistake.

XX/XX/XXXX I filed XXXX separate disputes XXXX because of a refund that I was supposed to get for my vendor and XXXX against a vendor that charge me for services not rendered. I was given a credit provision to a investigation on the transaction. So I still was able to use my debit card going forth and made multiple purchases all the way up to XX/XX/XXXX in which in the same day I made XXXX purchases with the same debit card. At around XXXX XXXX  I was attempting pay the bill for the food I rendered at establishment in XXXX Connecticut in my debit card repeatedly decline. So I called the bank customer service line in which I was informed that they shut my debit card down without warning because of the disputes filed on XX/XX/XXXX and the bank made the mistake by not taking this action immediately after me filing the dispute. Because they took this action without notifying me I was not able to pay for my food because without my debit card you can not even go to the ATM machine and the bank was closed so because I couldn't pay for my food I got security called on me and was banned from the establishment because I could not pay for the food I rendered and I was very embarrassed. To add M & T bank don't have no provision in which if they shut your debit card down because of fraudulent transaction can be offered a temporary XXXX so you can make debit and ATM transactions. You have to wait XXXX to XXXX business days for a new card and can only gain access to your money by actually going to the bank doing business hours in which restricts your access to your own money. In conclusion because of M & T bank actions I was harmed because I was kicked out of the establishment because I can not pay for a service that I rendered because I was not informed that my debit card was not active.

2024-02-24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of significant concern regarding fraudulent account reporting on my credit report. As per the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ), I am entitled to accurate and up-to-date information in my credit report, and I believe that this fundamental right has been compromised due to fraudulent activity.

Upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered an account that I did not authorize or open. The account in question appears to be associated with [ Name of Creditor/Lender ], and the reported balance and payment history do not align with any accounts that I have opened or used.

I must emphasize that I have not initiated any transactions with [ Name of Creditor/Lender ], nor have I provided consent for the opening of such an account. Therefore, I firmly believe that this account is a result of identity theft or fraudulent activity.

In accordance with 15 U.S. Code 1681q, it is unlawful to obtain consumer reports under false pretenses or without a permissible purpose. Given the circumstances, I urge you to investigate this matter promptly and take appropriate action to rectify the fraudulent account reporting on my credit report.

I kindly request that you : Conduct a thorough investigation into the origin of the fraudulent account and the circumstances surrounding its inclusion in my credit report. 
Remove the fraudulent account from my credit report immediately to prevent further damage to my creditworthiness.

My wife mailed this check to XXXX that same day, but the check was apparently stolen from the mail. 
We were unaware of any problem with this check until we received a XX/XX/2022 letter from XXXX to me, advising that We have not received your annual premium payment that was due on XX/XX/2022 and that my life insurance policy had therefore lapsed. I verified that check no. XXXX, including an image of the front of the check only, did appear on our most recent Chase statement, but XXXX insisted that it had not received payment. 
I therefore ordered a front-and-back image of check no. XXXX from Chase. On receiving a copy of both sides of the check, I noticed that the back was endorsed with a scarcely legible signature, XXXX XXXX XXXX, or something close to that. It was not endorsed to the payee on the front of the check, XXXX. 
I showed check no. XXXX to Chase XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, at the branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  NY XXXX, on XX/XX/2022. XXXX XXXX agreed that the endorsement was a bad forgery and added that he did not understand how the check was ever accepted in the first place. He said I would receive credit within 90 to 120 days and asked me to fill out a Declaration of Unauthorized Endorsement or Altered Item, which I did. 
It has now been 120 days but I have received no credit, and only further evasion, from Chase. XXXX  a XXXX from Chase at XXXX ext. XXXX told me, falsely, that Chase was not liable for the check and that my only remedy was against the depositary bank, reportedly XXXX XXXX  in California. He also told me that Chase was pursuing XXXX XXXX, and asked me to wait another 90 to 120 days while it did so. XXXX admitted that he could not tell me when, or whether, I would receive credit for the altered check. 
Chase has no excuse for debiting my account for a stolen check that was not endorsed by the payee or even in the name of the payee. Ultimate liability for the stolen check may be with XXXX XXXX  but Chase is liable to me for the {$5000.00}, with interest.

Following the completion of the consolidation loan, XXXX began reporting the {$210000.00} consolidation loan as XXXX separate loan accounts on my consumer credit profile, XXXX loan in the amount of {$30000.00} representing the subsidized portion of the debt and a second loan in the amount of {$180000.00} representing the unsubsidized portion of debt. From the loan origination date in XXXX  2021 to XXXX  2023 ( 17 months ), XXXX was reporting my student loan debt of {$210000.00} as XXXX separate loans. 

However in XXXX  2023, XXXX discontinued reporting the debt as XXXX loans as indicated above and began reporting the debt as XXXX loan. XXXX executed this reporting change by deleting all records of the {$180000.00} loan from my consumer credit reports and subsequently reported the deleted loan as a balance increase of the {$30000.00} subsidized loan account. Despite having the knowledge that the loan had an established XXXX account history by XXXX  2023, XXXX made no effort to address the reporting inaccuracies inherent to the reporting change. XXXX knowingly implemented changes to the reporting of my student loans that created material inaccuracies to my credit profile. As of the date of this complaint, there is no record of my student my {$180000.00} loan debt from XXXX  2021 XXXX  2023. From a risk perspective, reporting my student loan debt as a {$30000.00} installment loan established in XXXX  2021XX/XX/XXXX that increased to {$210000.00} in XXXX  2023 in not only falsely representing the loan history, but it also inaccurately presents me as a higher risk consumer, falsely representing that I have incurred significant new debt in the past XXXX  months. As a consumer, I have a right to dispute incomplete and inaccurate information on my credit reports and yet, when I disputed these obvious inaccuracies, XXXX and the CRAs failed to act as required by law. 

It is my hope that filing this complaint will result in swift resolution of this matter by a complete updating of my student loan account. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter to ensure that my credit profile is accurate.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",FL,334XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-06-20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,9307478

On XX/XX/ a provisional credit was issued in the amounts of {$2500.00} and {$1900.00}. 
USAA failed to promptly provide written disclosures to the consumer summarizing the consumers liability for unauthorized EFT 's, failed to provide means to identify the consumer to whom the access devise was issued, failed to provide the telephone number and address for reporting that an unauthorized EFT has been made. 
Per the EFT Act, the financial institution was notified 1 day after the unauthorized electronic transfer and a representative from USAA identified that the device that was used to complete this unauthorized EFT was in fact an android phone, which they were also able to see that the consumer who holds the account at USAA is not an android user. 
The consumer also filed an FTC report for identity theft as another precaution. USAA has refused to take responsibility for the account takeover fraud and has deemed the consumer liable for the unauthorized ETF. The consumer has done business with USAA in good faith for over 12 years. The consumer has been harmed by losing faith in the financial institution put in place to protect their nonpublic personal information and their money. 
The EFT Act protects consumers from situations like this under Section 205.6 Consumer Liability & Error Resolution. It states that the extent of the consumers liability is determined solely by the consumers promptness in notifying the financial institution. Other factors may not be used as a basis to hold consumers liable.

USAA is holding the consumer liable for {$1900.00}. The reversal of the provisional credit has placed the consumers account in the negative and has put the consumer in a vulnerable state.

The persistence of errors in my credit profile raises concerns about a significant oversight of FCRA regulations within your agency. 

To elaborate : The Fair Credit Reporting Act is a pivotal federal statute governing the accurate collection, maintenance, and transparent reporting of consumer credit information. 

Instances of FCRA violations include : Inaccurate financial data furnished by creditors to reporting agencies. 
Agencies consolidating individuals ' information based on name or social security number similarities. 
Failure to adhere to prescribed dispute-resolution protocols. 
Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I'm entitled to : Verify the accuracy of my report, particularly for employment purposes. 
Receive notification if my file information has been used against me in credit applications or transactions. 
Dispute and demand correction or removal of incomplete, erroneous, or unverifiable data. 
Request the removal of outdated negative information, typically after seven years or ten in cases of bankruptcy. 
I formally request the immediate removal of the listed items below. These items significantly breach FCRA standards due to inaccuracies, lack of verifiability, and ongoing invalidation. Their presence has caused considerable distress, notably evident in my recent denial of extended credit due to errors originating from your agency. 
1. The following personal information is incorrect Account Number : Previous Address ( es ) : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, AL XXXX XX/XX/XXXX 2. XXXX  Date of inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Inquiries have reached the statute of limitation. 

3. XXXX XXXX XXXX Date of inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Inquiries have reached the statute of limitation. 

4. XXXX Date of inquiry : XX/XX/XXXX Inquiries have reached the statute of limitation. 

5. XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX This accounts name and number are questionable. Either clarify this information to me or delete this account immediately from my credit report. 

6. XXXX XXXXXXXX Account Number : XXXX This accounts name and number are questionable. Either clarify this information to me or delete this account immediately from my credit report. 

7. XXXX Account Number : XXXX You can not report this account as updated when nothing has been changed! The same incorrect information is still being reported and nothing has been updated. You must remove these incorrect late payments from this account ASAP. 

8. XXXX Account Number : XXXX This accounts name and number are questionable. Either clarify this information to me or delete this account immediately from my credit report. 

9. XXXX, XXXX Account Number : XXXX It is not possible for you to update an account that I have no recollection of even belonging to me. You must remove this frivolous account immediately from my credit report. 


I anticipate prompt action to rectify these violations within the FCRA 's specified timeframe. Failure to comply will regrettably necessitate legal measures to ensure my rights under the FCRA are duly upheld.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted the merchant as I did not get my item, and was told via email on XX/XX/2018 that I would get a refund. Upon learning I would get a refund, I checked my visa card online at XXXX, and it showed I had a XXXX balance, so the refund had not come through yet. The following day, when I went to XXXX, it told me that the card number I entered was invalid, and that I should contact the merchant I bought it from. I then tried to call their customer service number off the back of the card, but got the message that the card number was not a valid number, and was not given any options to talk to a person to find out what happened to my refund. I had to use a different visa card I had purchased to finally get to talk to a representative, and was informed that the card had been blocked due to the refund, and that the money would be available in 3 days, but I had to call back to get the card activated after the three days. When I called back again on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that it would take another 2 days to have the money available, at which time I demanded to talk to a supervisor, and finally got my money. I wasted over 2 hours in total trying to get them to reactivate my card that they deactivated when the refund came in, which they won't compensate me for. I am positive the issuer has instituted this policy to steal refunds from cardholders by making it impossible to check on their cards to see if the refund has come in, and by making it extremely time-consuming to get the card reactivated after they deactivate it. When I finally got through to the last person, he wanted me to verify the date of the purchase in addition to all of the background information I previously supplied to the other customer service people in a final attempt to delay giving me my refund - and since I could not look at my online history for that card, I was lucky I still had my email receipt or they would have further delayed the refund. I want this policy stopped - it has happened to me with other pre-paid credit card companies on 3 other occasions ( when {$1.00} charges appeared on my card which were not authorized, and when I disputed them, they did the same thing to the card, de-activating it and not allowing me to see any information on it or get info via the customer service number ) and while it is not financially practical for individuals to do so, it clearly is in the best interest of all comsumers that you do something.",,Blackhawk Network Holdings Inc.,WI,549XX,,Consent provided,Web,2018-08-30,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3006519

2018-01-09,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Mobile or digital wallet,Unauthorized transactions or other transaction problem,,"I have an account with PayPal that I use to make online payments. I also subscribed to the XXXX XXXX remote access service. I noticed yesterday ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) that PayPal made an unauthorized debit to my checking account on XXXX XXXX for {$240.00} - the annual subscription fee to my XXXX service. I had already paid the {$240.00} annual subscription fee on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

I called XXXX customer support and talked with "" XXXX '' ( case # XXXX ) who assured me that XXXX did not initiate the {$240.00} unauthorized charge to my account on XXXX XXXX. XXXX followed up with an email ( attached ) repeating his assurance that XXXX had not initiated the charge. While on the phone with XXXX, I cancelled my subscription to XXXX. 

I then went to the PayPal website, logged in, and checked my account activity. To my horror, I discovered that PayPal, since at least early XXXX, has charged my bank account four times each year for my XXXX annual subscription overcharges totaling {$1600.00} since XXXX XXXX. 

I spoke with a PayPal customer service rep by phone ( case # XXXX ). The customer service rep insisted that XXXX ( not PayPal ) had initiated the charges, whereas XXXX at XXXX insisted that XXXX did not initiate the unauthorized charges. A classic case of Finger-Pointing. 

The PayPal rep said that PayPal will provide an official response within ten days. However, PayPal refuses to look at anything but the most recent charge for {$240.00} made on XXXX XXXX. 

My account activity on the PayPal website shows the unauthorized charges. However, the XXXX website does not reflect any of the unauthorized charges that PayPal attributes to XXXX and which PayPal debited to my checking account. This leads me to suspect that PayPal may have been hacked to defraud consumers and that PayPal is in denial about the problem. 

Here are the details. I had one subscription to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) during this period. However, XXXX charged the full annual subscription fee four times each year - on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. PayPal ( supposedly on behalf of XXXX ) charged my bank account {$240.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - PayPal transaction ID # XXXX ; {$240.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - trans. ID # XXXX ; {$240.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - trans.ID # XXXX ; {$240.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - trans. ID # XXXX ; {$240.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - trans. ID # XXXX ; {$140.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - trans. ID # XXXX ; {$140.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - trans. ID # XXXX ; {$140.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - trans. ID # XXXX ; {$140.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - trans. ID # XXXX ; {$99.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - trans. ID # XXXX ; {$70.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - trans. ID # XXXX ; and {$99.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - trans. ID # XXXX ). 

( Note : XXXX raised their annual subscription prices 350 % since the beginning of XXXX without prior notice to its customers, but that 's another issue ). 

PayPal sends email notices when it charges my checking account. However, the email notices fail to include a description of the services provided or the period covered - this field is left blank on the email notices. This is a serious lapse in PayPal and XXXX XXXX internal controls that makes it difficult for consumers to identify fraudulent charges. 

The reasons that I am contacting the CFPB directly are that these illegitimate charges involve more than one online company and that these erroneous charges may be the tip of a much larger consumer fraud iceberg.

I am writing to express my profound dissatisfaction and frustration regarding the persistent fraudulent items that continue to mar my credit report. Despite numerous attempts on my part to rectify this issue, I have yet to witness any substantial progress in their removal. 

I have conscientiously monitored my credit report and have identified a distressing number of fraudulent entries that have absolutely no association with my financial history. These fraudulent items encompass a range of discrepancies, including list specific fraudulent items, such as unauthorized accounts, late payments, or collections. These inaccuracies are not only decimating my credit score but also causing immense anxiety and distress. 

I first discovered these fraudulent entries before and since then, I have undertaken extensive efforts to address this situation : I submitted formal dispute letters to your agency, meticulously delineating each fraudulent item and providing exhaustive documentation to substantiate their inaccuracy. 

Subsequently, I have made innumerable follow-up inquiries through written correspondences and phone calls to ascertain the status of my dispute and to urge expedited resolution. 

In full compliance with your agency 's prescribed procedures, I filed identity theft reports with the pertinent authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), to meticulously document the fraudulent activities and bolster my claims. 

Despite my arduous efforts and my unwavering commitment to following your agency 's dispute resolution process to the letter, these fraudulent items have endured on my credit report, inflicting irreparable harm to my financial credibility and peace of mind. I ardently believe that immediate and unequivocal action is imperative to remedy this dire situation. 

Consequently, I kindly insist upon the following actions to be executed without delay to redress this matter : I implore your agency to undertake an accelerated and comprehensive investigation into the fraudulent items on my credit report. A swift resolution is absolutely vital to mitigate the considerable harm these inaccuracies have engendered. 

Upon confirmation of the fraudulent nature of these items, I demand their instantaneous removal from my credit report. This action is non-negotiable to restore my financial credibility and peace of mind. 
I anticipate and demand timely and transparent communication from your agency concerning the status of the investigation and the steps being taken to resolve this matter. Frequent updates on the progress of my dispute are imperative to rebuild my eroded trust in your services. 

In light of these persistent fraudulent entries, I expect your agency to implement heightened security measures to safeguard my credit profile from further unauthorized activity. 

I recognize the complexities often associated with investigating and rectifying fraudulent items, but I wish to underscore the urgency of addressing my concerns without any further procrastination. The inaccuracies on my credit report have inflicted severe damage on my financial stability, thwarting my ability to access loans or credit on equitable terms. 

I insist upon a comprehensive, written response to this formal complaint withinthe exact timeframe from the date of this letter. This response should delineate the concrete actions taken by the XXXX Credit Bureaus to resolve this matter. Please be aware that my patience is wearing thin, and the continuation of this situation will leave me with no alternative but to pursue legal remedies.

I had a credit card from an old business that was charged off. As a part of my agreement, I understand that I am liable for the balance owed and that money from my personal account could be used to satisfy the balance due on the card. That is not my dispute. 

My dispute is that now on multiple occasions, I have filed a complaint and spoken with Bank of America, Regulatory Affairs, bump on a log, XXXX XXXXXXXX who last time we spoke said he was working on my case and would call me back. I repeated on I'm sure a recorded line, I want to set up a payment plan. I was told that if I set up a payment plan, Bank of America would not withdrawal my personal account down to XXXX. I never received any calls from XXXX, emails from XXXX or correspondence from XXXX  regarding my options after leaving multiple messages for him. 

Now I'm reading responses on the CFPB complaint that are essentially generic responses and LIES claimining I DECLINED a payment plan .... This morning I woke up to {$5200.00} withdrawn from my personal account and my rent is due today ... and my account is XXXX. 

I have filed a complaint with the Attorney Generals Office and will continue to file complaints about Bank of Americas predatory lies claiming I declined a payment plan which I would never have done - obviously I'm not sitting on a pile of cash with the ability to write it off losses on the backs of tax payers like Bank of America does. 

I'm not sure that the CFPB is useful as once I submit this complaint, XXXX XXXXXXXX, the loser he's been in resolving my issue... gets a copy and has a job to half-ass do, to not resolve it with a payment plan that I called confirming I wanted to set up and then put some generic trash response on the website so it looks like he did something for me, the consumer that is apparently being protected by the CFPD... 

We will see.

I was transferred to a supervisor named XXXX, who was dismissive and uncooperative throughout our conversation. Despite my attempts to obtain more information about whom I was speaking with, XXXX provided no further details and insisted on rushing through the call. Her constant interruptions and evident disinterest in assisting me were unprofessional and disrespectful. 

Repeatedly, XXXX talked over me, repeating the same unhelpful information and refusing to consider any solutions that could assist me or preserve our customer relationship. When I requested to be transferred to her manager, hoping for a resolution, she flatly refused and continued to speak over me. Even after I politely asked her to stop interrupting and allow me to finish my sentences, she persisted. The call ended abruptly when she hung up on me as I was about to request the closure of all four of my Chase accountsa decision I was considering due to the poor service. 

I am appalled by the audacity and rudeness displayed by your customer service representative. Such behavior is not only inappropriate but also harmful to the trust and loyalty I have placed in Chase over the years. I am still shocked by the lack of courtesy and professionalism, which has led me to reconsider my relationship with your bank. 

I expect a formal apology and a reconsideration of my initial request to downgrade my card without the annual fee. Furthermore, I would like assurance that this feedback will be used to prevent similar experiences for other customers in the future.

Despite my previous 2 written requests, the unverified items listed below still remain on my credit report in violation of Federal Law. You stated in your responses to my 2 dispute letters that you have verified that the items listed below are accurate but you failed to send me copies of the documents that you used to verify these accounts as per my request. The fact that you have ignored my request to send me copies of the documents that you used to verify the disputed accounts is evidence that you can not and did not verify any of the disputed accounts like you said you did. Your failure to delete the disputed accounts that you can not verify after two written requests is also evidence of your willful disregard of Federal Law.

When we go to litigation and through the discovery process you will be required to produce these documents along with an affidavit swearing under oath that these are the true and correct documents that you used to verify the disputed accounts. The fact that you don't have any of the said documents in your files is proof that you did not properly verify the accounts within 30 days as required by law and the Court will order you to delete them.

You say that you have reinvestigated these accounts but you've admitted that all you have done is parroted information given to you by other sources and shifted the burden back to me to contact the original creditor to verify these accounts which is clearly in violation of 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ).

I also asked you to give me the name of the person in your company who verified the accuracy of these accounts but you ignored this request as well which is another violation of Federal Law and evidence of your willful disregard of the law. 
Please be advised that under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA- you are required to "" ..promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified. '' I request that you do this immediately. 
The law is very clear as to the Civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA. 
I demand that you delete all of the accounts listed below immediately. Please provide me with a copy of an updated and corrected credit report showing that these items have been deleted.

Well, if you start speaking to a XXXX XXXX number, and do not follow the prompts, you will miss the opportunity to speak with the person whom you are trying to reach. They do that to make you give them your REAL cell phone number -- because they "" sell '' these numbers to other financial agencies and they wanted my REAL number for that  purpose -- they do not care about me as a consumer. I finally outed them on XXXX and I got someone to call me. Through their website, my score was XXXX!!!! How can it be that big of difference? In one day? They are fraudulently giving me numbers because they want me to purchase their products and I outed them on social media to other consumers who were having trouble because of them -- for some of the same reasons. I tried to get an "" annual report '' and they put some type of discrepancy on my report as if they are "" unsure '' of my zip code. So when I do apply for credit or try to get my lawful annual report, they don't immediately give it to me. 

These people are not even a US based company and should not have access to so much consumer personal information. They are retaliating against me! They also told me if I wanted to add my yearly income that might help my FICO -- that just helps them sell more of my information. Your score is your score regardless! I think they want me to PAY for Experian "" boost ''. Credit bureaus should not be money-making organizations, because their goal is not to actually help the consumer -- they work against the consumer. 

I also see other things such as multiple hard inquiries that should not be there and an "" account '' from a company that was discharged when I filed bank on my report that should not be there. They are clearly retaliating! I have worked hard to repair my credit and one of the bureaus is working against me.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,AR,716XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2020-08-07,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3783716

Here 's the even BIGGER problem : My report has addresses I don't even recognize! It's like someone else who has a similar name might be living where I don't! This is scary because it could mean someone opened accounts in MY name without me knowing! 

The worst part? My friend can use the Experian website just fine. This makes me think something might be wrong with MY account specifically, or maybe the website is buggy for some people.

The banking system is contingent upon equitable and accurate credit reporting, as stated in the equitable Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681 ). The banking system 's efficacy is directly impacted by inaccurate credit reports, and the public 's confidence is undermined by unfair credit reporting methods, which are essential for the system 's continued operation. 

Therefore, the efficiency of the finance system is compromised whenever the FCRA is violated. This is a violation of my privacy with respect to my consumer report, as I have the authority to determine which items are included and which are not. XXXX XXXX  is the act of reporting any accounts without my written consent. 

This is a violation of both 15 U.S. Code 1681b ( 2 ) and 15 U.S. Code 1681c-2. This results in civil liability against the credit reporting agency for negligent and willful noncompliance under 15 U.S. Code 1681n. The law permits a {$1000.00} fine per violation for each account listed without my expressed written assent. 

I reviewed my consumer reports and observed accounts that I had never granted anyone permission to report. Consumer reporting agencies have taken on a critical role and are obligated to report consumer information with the utmost accuracy, as the Fair Credit Reporting Act explicitly stipulates. I did not provide written consent to report them. I am expressing my dissatisfaction with the contents of the attached file.

2018-07-19,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX from Sun Trust Mortgage noting a shortage in my escrow of roughly {$940.00}. I recently purchased my home and closed on XX/XX/2018 and through my closing company was under the impression that my escrow was collected with a small cushion so that there would NOT be any surprises. I called Sun Trust and spoke to a representative who confirmed with me that my account only had a few {$200.00} some dollars in it and was short the {$940.00} so Sun Trust had to pay my county taxes for me and there for I needed to pay the deficit back. The letter stated that if I did nothing about this the shortage would start to be pulled out of my account at of XX/XX/2018. I also apparently had the option to write a check to them in the full amount to prevent the monthly increase. 
From this information I then called my Closing company : XXXX XXXX ( NMLS # XXXX5 ) Branch Manager XXXXXXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX ( NMLS # XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MN XXXX XXXX XXXX told me that this rarely happens and he has never heard of it happening, he looked into the closing document and then called XXXX XXXX to confirm that they had received the payment at closing. XXXX called me back quickly and confirmed that XXXX XXXX had received the check as well as one from Sun Trust which they sent back to Sun Trust as the amount had already been paid. 

I called Sun Trust customer help again and explained the situation again, the person told me that they were still showing a shortage in my escrow but then sent me to the tax department. The gentleman I spoke to in the tax department confirmed that they had in face received the check back from XXXX XXXX and were processing it. He didn't say when they received the check but assured me that because they had the check I WOULD NOT have the additional amount pulled out of my bi-monthly payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the amount pulled DID include the deficit - this was NOT what the statement dated XX/XX/XXXX claimed as it clearly stated that the amount would NOT be pulled until XX/XX/XXXX. This is also not what the representative told me from Sun Trust and was very upsetting. 

I then called Sun Trust again, spoke to another customer service representative who confirmed that the "" missing '' tax monies were showing up in my account. Upon further conversation she noted that the company only does a once a year escrow review. 

When I returned home that day I received my XXXX Statement, NOT a notice that additional tax monies were credited to my account and noting that stated they were sorry for giving me a nightmare of a situation by sending an increase notice less than 3 months into owning my house. This was the XXXX statement, it noted on one line from XX/XX/XXXX that there was a repay escrow advance of - {$70.00} but then on XX/XX/XXXX a line item stated Tax Refund was listed in the amount of {$1200.00}. The amount Due was not the regular monthly payment of {$1200.00} but rather the amount that was given in the shortage notice of {$1300.00}. So the Tax Refund noted was NOT applied to my shortage. 

Apparently I have to ASK for a review of my escrow as this is not something that is done on an annual basis. So had I not called I would continue to be billed the higher amount for funds that I've already paid that would be just sitting in an account not of my own or of my wishing. 
This is not good business and I am not happy as to how this was handled and all the duress it has caused me especially as I'm still trying to settle down from the circumstances that lead me to the need to purchase a house.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"SUNTRUST BANKS, INC.",MN,55433,,Consent provided,Web,2018-07-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2967955

As quickly as I can, the assignments break the chain of title in the land records. The Chain of Custody of the title was broken. Custody of the Title actually goes from XXXX XXXX  XXXX, then to XXXX  XXXX XXXX quickly in XXXX, then to XXXX in XXXX, in XX/XX/XXXX goes to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Whats recorded on land record is XXXX XXXX, then assigned to XXXX in XXXX, skipping XXXX completely, the signature on the assignment is a XXXX employee signing as VP. They actually had a system set up where employees could pay {$25.00} to be able to call themselves VP Either XXXX or anyone of the other member banks that make up the XXXX system. I have the article on this, its called robot signing, The next assignment was another {$25.00} as as Vice President of XXXX, Another Robo signer, this time the person was a notary in Florida and also a vice president of XXXX. 

The time of the actual transfer of the mortgage to the Assignment of the mortgage on the land records must be with inside a 15 day time period as a XXXX XXXX time period. XXXX XXXX XXXX NEVER registered, XXXX, acquired the mortgage in XXXX from XXXX but didnt register the assignment until XXXX, outside the Safe Harbor by 4 years, the Assignment to XXXX XXXX have no Idea when it was transferred, they are required to notify me 30 days before the transfer and the servicer is required to notify me by 4 months after the transfer. The assignment was recorded in XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX, I didnt know who XXXX XXXX until I saw the Writ of Seizure on the my door. See The XXXX XXXX sent a first notice of foreclosure, which is required, right after I faxed over some amendments to the loan modification contract that they didnt agree with apparently. After that a company named ( XXXX ) started the proceedings, with no notice of foreclosure previously, furthermore, XXXX wasnt on the XXXX XXXX less mentioned on the civil proceeding document at all. I was never informed of the transfer to XXXX within 30 days of the transfer and I was not given the notice of foreclosure from the company putting me in the foreclosure. Also, after the loan modification was signed in XXXX of XXXX the modification was not recorded until XXXX, outside the 30 day required time frame. The title is curative it says so on the Assignment, how can they bring the foreclosure? 

Its a Major tax matter because the XXXX XXXX rule is in place for the banks to record in a timely manner to pay the fees to the local XXXX XXXX XXXX as well as to pay local the XXXX taxes. Tax evasion, this is what the XXXX XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX judges vs. XXXX I mentioned, was about. To sum up the rules to Securitization of the mortgages, banks have to make XXXX successful transfers of the mortgage to put the Mortgage into the XXXX XXXX XXXX with IRS XXXX the time frame and tax filings MUST be met and filing fees as well as the TAXES paid to be in accordance with the law and in order to Securitize the loan and make literately billions off of an average {>= $1,000,000} mortgage. I have a XXXX XXXX presentation video that details this process its shows how they do a forensic mortgage audit, it explains the process and goes over some defenses to use with clients who are unaware of the elements involved in the fraud. XXXX will private label the whole thing for attorneys. This is the same issue from XXXX during the housing bubble and the XXXX scandal. This mess has forced me to take a closer look, read a lot and learn how the law works, and the history that is not talked about too much, The Banks are by law, meant to be XXXX who extend our credit from the Treasury, we pay the fees but any continuing payments to the bank is not necessary. I am the original creditor, the Mortgage contract is a, unilateral, gratuitous, unconscionable contract. There was no meeting of the minds like a in lawful contract. These hidden elements were intended to defraud me, XXXX example is the bank never put in any equity of their own like I did for the creation of this mortgage, yet they collect all the proceeds, and keeping all of My Interest over all these years. There are multiple cares act violations, they put me into regular payments, then defaulted me when I was actually on the Forbearance, I was forced to pay while in the Forbearance. The XXXX sanctioned XXXX for these Violations but they deny doing this to m, they decided to out right LIE to the XXXX in XXXX and not answer a single question with the answers to my questions. So this really makes the XXXX look real bad for covering the XXXX. The XXXX also sanctioned XXXX for a pay to pay scam that I was a victim of that also. 
How can a judge even see a unregistered note in the court? Isn't it out of the jurisdiction of the public court to handle the PRIVATE instrument? The note as we know is not a promissory note and most are made to believe, yes the word promise makes it sound like there is some kind of promise, not at all. The bank cashed the NOTE. You can see on the XXXX XXXX, I have requested the following via fax more than once before they put me in foreclosure, not excluding other documents in possession, original contract, note, truth- in lending disclosures, closure disclosure, transference contract, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX filings on behalf of NAH, payoff, security interest accounts in NAH, and form XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ; information as to the amount of debt ; consumer statement ; verification of the banks claim or ownership of the debt. a legend to symbols used, for each presentment. I know there is 3 escrow accounts, I want to see all of them. I never received a loan, it was an extension of my own credit. Banks are the intermediary for us to treasury, The fraud the Bank is perpetrating on me and my family is truly sick and criminal. 
There is no note, I have testimony from a previous case don't even have the original wet in signature note is was either hypothecated and lost or just lost, separating the Note and the mortgage, nullifying the contract. The Judge should have know to have the Original wet ink signature note in hand before placing a finical instrument like a Writ of Seizure on my door. There is a Fax to the court as the cover for the order for foreclosure says here is the foreclosure documents we have the note. Which is not what the law requires. The Lawer and the judge should be aware of this. That would mean a big mess for a lot of other families that have been foreclosed on, they are all talking it out on the internet chat, Town hall meetings, even at the local grocery stores. The truth will set you free, but its look like it is just an insult to my intelligence in this case.

2024-05-25,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX Re : Dispute of Inaccurate Credit Reporting by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate reporting of a charge-off account on my credit reports by XXXX XXXX XXXX. The details of the account in question are as follows : - Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX - Account Number : XXXX - Account Type : Credit Line - Balance : {$500.00} - Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX )/ XX/XX/XXXX ( Experian ) - Payment Status : Collection/Chargeoff - Last Reported : XX/XX/XXXX - Date Last Active : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX )/ XX/XX/XXXX ( Experian ) - Date of Last Payment : XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX & Experian ) - Comments : Charged off as bad debt, Canceled by credit grantor, Account has been closed due to inactivity, Unpaid balance reported as a loss by the credit grantor.

The issues with this account are as follows : 1. **No Contract with Collections Company : ** I have no contractual relationship with the collections company reporting this debt. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and 15 U.S. Code 1692e, debt collectors must report accurate information and must not use false, deceptive, or misleading representations. The absence of a direct contract with the collections company invalidates the reporting of this debt on my credit report. 

2. **Continuous Reporting of Charge-off : *XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX account has been reported as a charge-off every month for an extended period. According to IRS guidelines, an unpaid charge-off is considered income and should not be repeatedly reported. The continuous monthly reporting of this charge-off is misleading and does not accurately reflect the true status of the debt. Under the FCRA, information reported on my credit report must be accurate and not misleading.

3. **Sale of Debt : ** The debt associated with this account has been sold to another company. The original creditor should have updated the account status to indicate this change. Reporting the debt as an active charge-off after it has been sold is inaccurate and misleading.

4. **Issuance of Form 1099-C : ** I have requested a Form 1099-C from the original creditor, which should have been issued to indicate the cancellation of the debt. The absence of this form suggests that the debt should no longer be reported as active. 

I have previously disputed this matter with the credit bureaus ( XXXX, Experian, and XXXX ) and the original creditor, but the issue remains unresolved. Therefore, I am seeking the assistance of the CFPB to investigate this matter and ensure that my credit reports are corrected to reflect accurate information. 

Please find attached copies of relevant documentation, including my communications with the original creditor and the credit bureaus.

2022-07-24,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Struggling to pay your loan,Lender trying to repossess or disable the vehicle,"On XX/XX/2020, my vehicle was repossessed by XXXX XXXX, for Ally Financial. The repossession agent with XXXX XXXX unlawfully repossessed my vehicle by breaching the peach when they damaged my vehicle and towed my vehicle from my private property that was secured. When I learned of the repossession that morning after seeing that they entered my secured property, I reached out to Ally Financial to learn why. The company had never sent me any notice for potential repossession, and I wasn't that far behind on payments. The agents in the auto department refused to speak with me about the matter and directed me to their repossession department. Every time I called the repossession department, I was either on hold for several hours or they would disconnect the call on their end. After about 7 days of constant calling back in forth to recover my car, I finally spoke to someone. The agent refused to give me their names, but stated that in order to get my car, I would need to wire transfer the past balance. They would not accept online or certified funds. The agent gave me the account number to make the payment and I wired transferred the money as soon as they gave me the information. I called the following day to get the information for my car location, and the agents alleged that they never received the payment and that they could not release the location or phone number of the vehicle. I went back to the XXXX XXXX and resent another payment. The repossession department had kept me on hold for about 2.5 hours before they gave me the location of my vehicle. 

Upon arriving to the location of the car storage area that my vehicle was stored, I spoke with their office about my car and gave all the required identification and information given by the repossession department with Ally. They were very hostile during the process. They attempted to withhold my vehicle because I expressed I didn't feel comfortable signing their required forms for redemption prior to inspecting my car. The agent eventually allowed me to inspect my vehicle before asking for my signature. 

When the agents working in the lot finally brought my car to the entrance, I noticed that my car had been damaged and many of my personal property items were bagged and placed in my trunk. Additionally, my original car key fob did not work on my vehicle anymore. The car fob that the worker gave to me was old, damaged and not my original. Additionally, my car horn had been disabled, and the dashboard had said that my anti-theft system was disabled. The agent then attempted to reprogram new keys. I went back into the office and told them I was not signing the documents asking me to release the company from liability for property damage because they had. 

Later, I called Ally to tell them that my car had been damaged and they told me that it was nothing they could do about it. Eventually they gave me an email to escalate the situation. On XX/XX/2020, a representative from the XXXX XXXX department with Ally reached out and forwarded my complaint to XXXX. XXXX told me to take my car to a dealership and pay for the inspection and if that was the issue, they would reimburse me. However, I didnt not have the money to pay for a inspection and get reimburse later. The issue was never resolved. Additionally, I had a XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX  my car the night it was repossessed, and they were not in the bags that was in my trunk when I went through it. The company never responded to my inquiry about retrieving those items. Since then, Ally placed a fee on my account, that has caused me to accumulate many late fees. When I inquired about the late charges between XXXX, an agent finally communicated that I was getting late fees because I had not pay the repossession fee. So all payments I made for my car payment, did not go to my car payment, but to the Miscellaneous charges. This has caused me to have a very negative credit history, despite making timely payments most months. Eventually, the late charges accumulation made it difficult to keep up with payments, and I have a very negative credit history because of these actions.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,ALLY FINANCIAL INC.,IL,60622,,Consent provided,Web,2022-07-24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5804651

I have sent disputes to Experian multiple times reporting the errors in their reporting but somehow Experian continues to respond the accounts are verified as accurate. This is very confusing because the two accounts are reporting the same collection, yet they are reporting completely different information? Account XXXX is reported by XXXX with the DATE OF FIRST DELINQUENCY AS XX/XX/XXXX and the amount owed as {$3500.00} and XXXX is reporting the DATE OF FIRST DELINQUENCY AS XX/XX/XXXX with the amount owed as {$2400.00}. This is the exact same account as reported by the account number. That can not be possible, this is one account with one original Date Of Delinquency and one balance amount. I have also reported to Experian that I did not believe this account was mine due to another family member having the exact same first, middle and last name. Yet again, Experian does not even acknowledge my disputes. I have requested validation from XXXX and XXXX and NEITHER have provided ANY information showing this account belongs to me or proof that what is being reported is correct. XXXX and XXXX have both deleted these accounts from my report because they were unable to substantiate the account. What information does Experian have to report these accounts? And if Experian has correct information, then why are these accounts reporting with completely different Dates Of First Delinquency and different amounts reported?

And why has Experian completely ignored my requests for an investigation, yet continued to report the accounts?

I am now told that this was never done and can not be done on their end they can only take the payment. I had expressed to the representative at that time that I was calling because I was not able to login to my account and she reiterated more than once that she will get it done for me. This was on XX/XX/XXXX, so my XX/XX/XXXX payment should of processed through my XXXX XXXX account-it did not due to the bank account not being updated as promised. My payment returned account closed-I had more than enough funds in my account!! I provided my bank statements proving this as well. When I called and talked to XXXX ( agent id XXXX ) in escalations I asked her why no one ever called, no correspondence received, nor did any of the representatives I spoke with ever tell me that my payments were hitting a closed account. Her answer was they do n't have to tell me I should be watching my account. I thought XXXX was a reputable company that had integrity, but apparently not. They kept taking my payment-so they charged me late fees & return payment fees. I could tell that I was not going to get any empathy from this rep from the beginning of the call, she talked over me and when I asked for another representative or her manager she told me she will have them call me back. I had to ask her what the name of the person who will be calling and she said she does not know. I asked her what time the call would be made-SHE THEN told me 7-10 business days. Mind you she is in escalation and I have tried to call them on my break to ask them to review my documents showing that I had more than enough funds in the account at that point in time, also the fact that they called me to tell me my payment was due, but failed to mention the issue so I was never aware. I HAVE ASKED THEM NUMEROUS TIMES TO PULL THE CORRECT CALL-to no avail. Now I have a late payment mark ( the only one I have on my all my reports ) due to XXXX being unethical and allowing their representatives to withhold information from their customers for financial gain in fees. I also show that I am on auto pay on my profile, but according to XXXX in customer service I am not. I feel like this is another ploy to get more money for fees.

2018-08-17,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"On XX/XX/2005, myself, my wife and my mother entered into a 30-year fixed rate mortgage in the amount of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars ( {$490000.00} ) with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( hereinafter original mortgage ). We all executed the original mortgage as joint tenants and entered into a Deed of Trust related to the original mortgage. 

Just before XXXX XXXX XXXX  went out of business, a salesperson came by our house and offered my wife a chance to refinance from our original mortgage and into an adjustable rate mortgage ( a new mortgage ). This was also around the time where the Department of Justice alleges that XXXX was targeting XXXX women and tricking them into refinancing out of their fixed rate mortgages and into riskier ( but more profitable for XXXX ) adjustable rate mortgages. My wife is XXXX by the way. 

As a result, XXXX convinced my wife to sign documents, she was told were just placeholders for a refinance and new mortgage. 

I informed XXXX that I was not willing to refinance the property from my existing fixed rate mortgage and into the adjustable rate mortgage. 

XXXX, using only my wifes signature and without my consent, refinanced our original mortgage ( fixed rate ) and into the current adjustable rate loan, currently being serviced by Carrington Mortgage Services LLC. 

When XXXX refinanced the property from the original mortgage and into the new adjustable rate loan, currently serviced by Carrington, the original mortgage was paid off as part of the refinance into the adjustable rate loan, but the Deed of Trust associated with the original mortgage was not reconveyed as part of that process, even though it is required by law. 

When XXXX paid off the original mortgage ( Note ) attached to the Deed of Trust, with the money used from the refinance, XXXX was required by California State law to reconvey, or transfer the Deed of Trust for the original mortgage to the trustor as part of the refinance. This did not happen. 

XXXX also told us that because the new adjustable rate loan was between XXXX and my wife only, that a new Deed of Trust would not be filed, that the "" mortgage '' was really just a loan and an "" unsecured '' loan. That may be why the original Deed was not reconveyed. Although this is not very common, as the future would prove, XXXX was more interested in making a quick buck in selling the new adjustable rate mortgage than they were in actually collecting on the loan, through a Deed of Trust. 

My complaint is that Carrington got ahold of the original Deed of Trust and because the original Deed of Trust did not go through the reconveyance process and is still on file with the XXXX County Recorders Office,  Carrington is using that expired and invalid Deed of Trust, or threatening to use that Deed of Trust, to foreclose on the home. 

In other words, Carrington is using a Deed of Trust that was paid off over twelve years ago as leverage to get me to pay on a loan that was paid off over twelve years ago, simply because twelve years ago XXXX XXXX XXXX broke the law and did not reconvey the Deed of Trust as required by California law. 

My concern is that Carrington will actually try to foreclose on the house, using this invalid and bogus Deed of Trust just because nobody noticed that the Deed of Trust did not go through the reconveyance process, more than ten years ago. I didn't even know this until Carrington 's lawyers presented it to me as a valid document, just last month. 

To the unknowing person, the Deed of Trust seems legitimate. Even worse, it would if you didn't know the Deed of Trust is invalid, the loan could be resold again and again, with each new buyer getting ripped off, because they believe the Deed of Trust in Carrington 's possession is the actual Deed of Trust for the loan they are buying. This could create an endless cycle of people getting duped. 

Maybe that's why the loan has bounced around from so many loan servicing companies over the past year or so. 

Even though Carrington is basically only threating me right now, they might just do it. They might foreclose using this bogus and invalid document, because its still on file. If they do, this would create a legal nightmare for myself and any unsuspecting buyer, thinking that the Deed of Trust being presented by Carrington is legitimate. 

California Civil Code section 2941 was established to avoid this exact issue. California Civil Code section 2941 ( b ) ( 1 ) requires the beneficiary, upon payoff, to execute and deliver to the trustee the original note, deed of trust, request for a full reconveyance. The trustee then executes and records the full reconveyance within 21 days of receipt of the documents from the beneficiary, delivers a copy of the reconveyance to the beneficiary and, upon request, delivers the original note and deed of trust to the trustor. ( Civ.Code 2941, subd. ( b ) ( 1 ) ( A ) - ( C ). ) In this case, because the Original Mortgage associated with the Deed of Trust in Carringtons possession was paid off by the refinance into the Adjustable Rate Loan currently being serviced by Carrington, the Deed of Trust associated with the original mortgage and in Carringtons possession, must be reconveyed immediately as  required by California Civil Code 2941 ( b ) ( 1 ). The law says Carrington is now legally required to fix this by reconveying the Deed. 

To do this, California State Law says that should a Deed of Trust not go through the process of reconveyance as required by the California Civil Code, within 75 days of fulfilling the obligations of the Note in a Deed of Trust, the beneficiary must substitute itself in as trustee and execute a full reconveyance. ( Civ.Code 2941, subd. ( b ) ( 2 ). ) California Civil Code also states that just because a Deed of Trust did not go through the process of reconveyance, it doesnt mean it is valid, nor does it extend the rights of the beneficiary under that Deed of Trust. After 75 days of fulfilling the obligation of a Note in a Deed of Trust, the Deed of Trust becomes a worthless piece of paper. But, youd probably have to be an attorney to know that. 

California State Law clearly states that if a Deed of Trust is not reconveyed within 75 days of the fulfillment of the Note associated with the Deed of Trust, the Deed is void and invalid. The Deed of Trust in Carringtons possession has been invalid for over ten years. 

Carrington is required by Law to abide by and comply with the Law. State Law requires them, or the beneficiary, to reconvey the Deed of Trust to the trustor immediately and not doing so or trying to use that Deed of Trust for any purpose would suggest that Carrington is potentially using the invalid Deed of Trust to engage in some sort of fraudulent activity. 

California State law also includes a process for a property owner to request the reconveyance of a Deed of Trust in the event the beneficiary or trustee is not willing or unable ( they went bankrupt ) to do so. This process does require the property owner to provide proof that the Note in the original Deed of Trust has or was paid. The proof I need would be as simple as a copy of the new adjustable rate mortgage, but Carrington and the previous loan servicing companies have not provided me with that document, despite multiple requests, including a request made as recently as three weeks ago. 

In fact, the only information myself or my wife have received is verbal information about the dates and amounts of the original fixed rate loan and not the adjustable rate loan. 

XXXX is out of business, XXXX XXXX XXXX has sold the loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the loan has bounced around from multiple loan servicing companies and nobody wants to even provide me with a copy of the adjustable rate loan so I can resolve this on my own. 

California Law requires that the Deed of Trust in Carrington 's possession be reconveyed to the trustor. They know about it and they know the law. They also know that withholding the information on the new adjustable rate loan, will make it difficult if not impossible for me to request the Deed of Trust be reconveyed without filing a lawsuit. The problem with that is, who do I sue? Counrtywide? XXXX XXXX XXXX? XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX? Carrington? One of the many loan servicing companies? The original Trustee? 

I would expect that there is some Regulatory Agency that can require Carrington to follow the law. The law says they must reconvey the Deed of Trust and the law describes a specific process to do that. 

If they do not reconvey the Deed of Trust, Carrington should be held responsible for knowingly breaking the law and potentially committing fraud.",,"CARRINGTON MORTGAGE SERVICES, LLC",WA,98110,,Consent provided,Web,2018-08-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2994497

I was told I would receive a confirmation email. Never received a confirmation email so I made a follow-up call and was told they did not make such an arrangement. I requested for them to check and see what was documented on my account. She stated sorry there was no documentation so I requested to have a supervisor listen to the recorded conversation and please return my call. I have never received a call from any of XXXX XXXX Managers so I called XXXX, XXXX still no response on the payment agreement. Later I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to assist with my past due balances they stated I owe {$26.00}, XXXX. My concern is that XXXX XXXX never mails or email out statements so you can track your actual balance so how would know what you actually owe? Now I have a third party involved but never was able to speak with a supervisor at XXXX XXXX to discuss my payment plan and concerns over balance owed to date. Currently OLIPHANT FINANCIAL are trying to collect {$26000.00} I sent registered mail a Validation of Debt Letter with no response? I spoke with a representative who was very harsh like a mobster! I explained my circumstances and needed validation of debt? He directly told me he would need payments to resolve this debt in one year at {$2200.00} a month! I never heard back from this collection agent for over two years!

I went through months of back and forth supplying documentation to support all of my income. At the end of the day, the denied the loan but I had already proceeded with a local state credit union because of the horrible customer service. The worst part was that US Bank intentionally appraised our home below market value by {$75000.00} to put us in a position where we had to pay mortgage insurance and they would not reimburse us for the poor appraisal.

However, this did not happen as promised. 

For the first CD, which matured in XX/XX/year>, I renewed it on XX/XX/year>, with a predefined interest rate of 5 % APY. However, over the subsequent five months, Citizens Bank failed to honor this agreement. The monthly interest payment was less than {$2.00}. I visited the branch twice, once in XXXX and again in XXXX, to address the issue. My concerns were ignored during the first visit in XXXX. After my last visit in XXXX, the bank finally began to address the problem. Unfortunately, the updated interest payments still do not match the agreed-upon terms. The most recent interest payment for the first CD was {$180.00}, whereas it should have been closer to {$300.00} as per our agreement. 

For the second CD, I also renewed it at a 5 % APY rate. Yet again, the new interest payments do not align with what was stated in the contract. The most recent payment was {$56.00}, while it should have been closer to {$180.00} as per our agreement.

All of which work in conjunction with each other, including the Truth In Lending Act ( TILA ) 15 USC 1601 et seq.

In order to make arrangements to pay an obligation which may be lawfully owed, please document and verify the debt by complying, in good faith, with this request for validation and return it to me, within thirty ( 30 ) days of receipt of this letter. This is NOT a request for verification or proof of Claimant mailing address, but a request for VALIDATION and PROOF OF CLAIM made pursuant to the above named Titles and Sections. I respectfully request that your offices provide Claimant with competent evidence as per the attached Declaration and Proof of Claim that I have any legal obligation to pay you the unsubstantiated alleged debt. Furthermore you shall cease all verbal communication. No phone calls to the Claimant. At this time I will also inform you that if your offices have reported invalidated information to any of the 3 major Credit Bureaus, such as, XXXX, Experian and XXXX prior to validation and proof of claim of the disputed debt, this action might constitute fraud under both Federal and State Laws. Due to this fact ; if any negative mark is found on any of Claimant credit reports by your company or the company that you represent I will not hesitate in bringing legal action against you and your client for the following : Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act Defamation of Character Violation of United States Code TITLE 18 PART 1 CHAPTER 63 1341 ( Mail Fraud ) This debt is considered to be invalid until I receive proper validation and your offices provide Claimant with proof of claim of the disputed debt. Your offices have 30 days to produce the required documentation in accordance with FTC guidelines. During this validation period and proof of claim, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of Claimant credit reports, said action will be considered a dishonor and cause the self-executing contract portion of this notice to be implemented. This includes any listing any information to a credit reporting repository that could be inaccurate or invalidated. If your offices fail to respond to this validation and proof of claim request within 30 days from the date of your receipt, all references to this account must be deleted and completely removed from Claimant credit file and a copy of such deletion request shall be sent to Claimant immediately.

The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitrators authority is limited solely to the Claims between Claimant and Respondent alone. The arbitration will not be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding. If Claimant prevails in the arbitration of any Claim against Respondent, Respondent will reimburse Claimant for any fees Claimant paid to the arbitration organization in connection with the arbitration. Any decision rendered in such arbitration proceedings will be final and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered in a court of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration provision applies to all Claims now in existence or that may arise in the future. The arbitration provision shall survive any voluntary payment of Claimants claim against Respondent, in full, or any bankruptcy by Respondent.

Should any provision on this agreement be found to not be enforceable by order of a court of  competent jurisdiction, it shall not adversely affect any other provision of this agreement and reasonable opportunity and effort shall be taken to modify it to become enforceable.

I believe that NVR has engaged in practices that are misleading and potentially predatory, resulting in significant financial and XXXX XXXX. The key issues I have encountered are as follows : 1. Lack of Communication Throughout the building and loan process, NVR has consistently failed to communicate effectively. Despite multiple inquiries, I have not received firm confirmation of the closing date, which has severely impacted my ability to schedule necessary utilities and equipment deliveries as well as move out of my current residence which has a firm deadline to move of XX/XX/2024. 

2. Prolonged and Uncertain Closing Date My original closing date was set for XX/XX/XXXX. It is now over XXXX months past that date, and the closing process remains rushed and uncoordinated. This prolonged delay is unreasonable and has caused considerable inconvenience. 

3. Mismanagement of Rate Lock and Float Down Option I paid XXXX XXXX of my loan ( XXXX ) for a rate lock and float down option with the understanding that if interest rates decreased, I could float down my original interest rate to a lower option and the {$30000.00} incentive XXXX homes agreed to would cover the remaining closing costs. However : - NVR did not communicate the true purpose of the float down option when it was offered. They continue to not directly answer my question on why the original interest rate isnt able to float down. 
- My inquiries about the float down option in XXXX, which would have lowered my interest rate to XXXX XXXX, were not addressed. My rate was not locked during this period because it fell outside the XXXX day window before the "" closing date, '' leading to a significantly higher current interest rate. 
- Last week, I was given only XXXX days to decide on utilizing the rate float down, which is insufficient time to make an informed decision. 

4. Discrepancies in Closing Costs and Fees The loan estimate provided indicates significantly higher closing costs than initially communicated. Specific issues include : - An unexplained requirement of {$17000.00} in cash to close, despite already paying an XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) of {$32000.00} and a XXXX XXXX fee for the rate float down. 
-A {$540000.00} property with a XXXX XXXX down payment should not result in total closing costs of approximately {$85000.00}. 

5. Potential Predatory Lending Practices The combination of poor communication, delays, mismanaged rate lock options, and significantly higher than expected costs suggests practices that align with predatory lending.",,NVR INC.,MD,20743,,Consent provided,Web,2024-06-05,Closed with explanation,Yes,,9169242

Despite my previous three dispute requests, Experian has continuously verified this account as "" Accurate '' without providing documented proof of late payments as requested. 

I am deeply concerned about the disregard for the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the lack of adherence to fair and accurate reporting practices. It is evident that Experian 's handling of my dispute does not align with the standards set forth by the FCRA, which mandates that consumers have the right to challenge and VERIFY the accuracy of information on their credit reports. 

I must highlight the discrepancies regarding the "" Last Activity '' dates associated with the "" XXXX XXXX '' account across all three credit bureaus. Each bureau displays a different "" Last activity '' date, which raises serious questions about the accuracy and consistency of the information being reported. 

Furthermore, it has come to my attention that while XXXX XXXX has reported one 30-day late payment to XXXX and Experian, it has reported to XXXX that I have NO late payments. This inconsistency in reporting violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ( rules, which require accurate and consistent reporting across all credit bureaus. 

Given the seriousness of this matter, I demand an immediate escalation for a thorough investigation into the inaccuracies associated with the "" XXXX XXXX '' account. I expect Experian to conduct a diligent and comprehensive review, including providing documented proof of any late payments associated with this account. 

Failure to address this issue promptly and appropriately will leave me no choice but to escalate my complaint to seek legal recourse for violations of my rights under the FCRA.

Since the scammer 's bank was not responding back to them, therefore refusing to release the funds they could not do anything until then. After XXXX  days, I contacted BofA again for an update at which time they further advised me that since the scammer 's bank did not respond back to them ( BofA ) would not release the scammed funds back and would not be refunding the {$2400.00}.

That someone, acting as an XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX linked into the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and fraudulently acted as an XXXX XXXX. BofA continued to refused to return the funds back to me.

2022-03-20,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am in the process of buying a home. They require student loan statements to show my monthly payment, but because of COVID forbearance I do not have a monthly payment or statements since XX/XX/XXXX, and the bank wanted something current. On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted an IDR  request for the primary purpose of receiving a letter from FedLoans telling me what my monthly payment would be on XX/XX/XXXX. I also assumed, reasonably I believe, that I needed to recertify before payments began again. I was trying to do my due diligence and get the paperwork my bank required. 

A week later on XX/XX/XXXX I called Fedloans and explained I needed documentation urgently. On XX/XX/XXXX they sent me a letter explaining that my monthly payment was and would remain at {$400.00} through XX/XX/XXXX, and I provided this documentation to my bank- it is upon this information that they approved my mortgage application. It was not clear from this letter whether or not Fedloans was still processing the IDR request, and so on XXXX I called and asked to cancel that request. I explained to the call rep that I did not know until receiving the XX/XX/XXXX letter that I was not required to recertify until XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me it's true that I was not required to recertify and that fedloans would be in touch with me about my cancelation request. 

Not only did I not hear from them about the cancelation request, but on XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification that the IDR request was approved and that my monthly payment would be increasing by {$160.00}. This is the opposite of what fedloans told me via mail on XX/XX/XXXX, and on the phone on XXXX, and differs significantly from what I told the bank. There are borrowers out there like me whose monthly payments will not change until next summer because they understood they did not have to recertify in the normal course of things- why should I have to pay more while those borrowers continue to pay based on what their payment was pre-forbearance? Why should I have to pay more when fedloans represented to me even after the recertification request was made that my monthly payment would remain at XXXX XXXXXXXX/month until next XXXX? Why should I have to pay more when I did not understand I was not required to recertify until XXXX of XXXX? Why didn't fedloans process or respond at all to my cancelation request? I need fedloans to revert my monthly payment back to what it was pre-pandemic.",,AES/PHEAA,NY,124XX,,Consent provided,Web,2022-03-20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,5345200

Then page XXXXof the XXXX. line XXXX amount received {$130.00}. Ok I paid {$1200.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX enclosed a copy. Then line XXXX amount received {$2200.00} on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ok I 've enclosed a copy. I see a payment was paid the rest to unapplied. Then paid another payment line XXXX with {$84.00} going towards late charges or outstanding fee balance then line XXXX {$170.00} Applied to principle. But then line XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX it says payment reversal. Why? Then line XXXX says non-sufficient funds reversal. Then line XXXX return item fee. Ok I do n't know why Wells Fargo took my money back. There was no way my check bounced why is that it 's because Wells Fargo was the one who wrote us a check from our restricted escrow account in the amount of {$9900.00} I 've enclosed a copy of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX statement showing XXXX that money was released. I 've enclosed a copy of the disbursement check voucher from when we received it. So, what happened to my money. Do you realize that that was the very beginning of that loan modification and right from the start I thought my money was being applied correctly. And feel it has not. Then line XXXX it looks like a payment was paid but in date due it says XXXX? XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX should have been covered. It 's should say XXXX date due. So, if I 'm incorrect please explain my statement. I did ask last week that if Wells Fargo seriously feels there 's no error I 'll hire a lawyer, but if maybe I 'm right and my alleged debt should be looked at and explained the errors I have found, we can talk the only reason I cease and desist Wells Fargo was because I wanted my debt in writing and I now have it.

The auction last weekend was difficult for me and my family to go through and here it 's happening all over again. I 've gotten a 3 day eviction notice, and unable to stop all this.

2023-12-20,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"Dear TransUnion Consumer Relations, I am writing to officially dispute the information contained in my consumer report, as provided by TransUnion. Upon careful review of my report, I have discovered undisclosed personal information about me that has been shared with a non-affiliated third party without my explicit written consent. This appears to be a violation of the regulations outlined in 15 U.S. Code 6802 - Obligations with Respect to Disclosures of Personal Information. 

As per my understanding of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am entitled to be informed about and control the disclosure of my personal information. The disclosure to a non-affiliated third party raises concerns about my privacy rights, as I was not given the opportunity to opt-out, as mandated by law. 

Upon meticulous examination of the report, I observed that specific accounts are being reported without my written consent. It is crucial to clarify that my dispute is not with the creditor but with TransUnion for disseminating and reporting information without proper authorization. 

I refer to 15 USC 1681b - Permissible Purpose, which mandates a consumer 's written consent for the reporting of personal information. Presently, I have not granted such written consent, and I kindly request documentation to validate my consent, demonstrating compliance with this legal requirement. Failure to provide evidence of my consent could be interpreted as a violation of my rights under the FCRA. 

Additionally, I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) concerning this matter, and the reference number for my complaint is XXXX. I believe that the unauthorized disclosure and reporting of my personal information may constitute a violation under 18 USC 1028a, potentially constituting identity theft.

Pursuant to 15 USC 1681c-2, I formally request the removal of the following accounts from my consumer report within four business days from the date of this letter : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  I affirm my right to a fair and accurate credit reporting process, emphasizing that the swift removal of these accounts is crucial to rectifying the reported inaccuracies. 

Furthermore, I request documentation regarding TransUnion 's method of verification for the disputed accounts and records showing proof of my option to opt out of the information being reported in my consumer report. This will ensure that TransUnion adheres to the necessary standards for accuracy and fairness in credit reporting. 

I anticipate your prompt attention to this matter and the resolution of my dispute within the specified time frame of four business days. Non-compliance with the provisions of the FCRA may result in further legal action.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",FL,34203,,Consent provided,Web,2023-12-20,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,8037842

I am in the process of getting a mortgage over the past year and a half. Each 90 days the two mortgage companies I am working with are pulling a hard credit check.

Experian said they could do nothing about hard credit inquiries since, by law they had to report them. The two week forgiveness period for multiple hard inquiries is not enough.

2022-11-21,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Trouble during payment process,,"I updated my Homeowners insurance toward the middle of XXXX to get a bundle and reduce the cost of my auto policy. The effective date shows XX/XX/XXXX. From my understanding, the servicing unit changed to XXXX XXXX effective XXXX. My mortgage is escrowed, so they sent the bill to Hompoint. When the bill was received in XXXX, somehow the bill received was not provided to XXXX XXXX on the transfer and so they are saying they had no record of a bill. The bill went unpaid and the new policy lapsed because of it. I received as the homeowner no notifications of this through the entire process, so I was not aware the policy was in cancelling, nor it had not been paid. I was going on with life thinking I updated my insurance and everything was fine. 

Around XXXX time frame, I received a letter from Homepoint stating that I needed to fax/email evidence of insurance. I did so using the copy of the policy purchased XX/XX/XXXX. I received a second letter a few weeks later asking for the same information "" XXXX and final notice '', this time I called them and found out that this policy had lapsed because of non-payment. This was the first I knew about it, sometime around XXXX timeframe. 

I immediately called to renew the policy and make updates. Because XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX will not reissue a policy when it cancels because of non-payment, I had to use a different insurance company, the very best I could find was {$640.00} more expensive. I was upset because this was not my fault. The bill was sent to Homepoint, but was never paid. If there was an issue, there was nothing sent to me notifying of such to allow me to address before it cancelled. 

The new servicing company, I now know as XXXX XXXX, submitted a "" bad debt claim '' to cover the {$640.00} increase as they understood that it was their fault for non-payment and the entire issue. I was to be called XX/XX/XXXX with resolution. No call ever came. 

I then received another letter from Homepoint XX/XX/XXXX asking for evidence of insurance between XXXX otherwise they would charge me for insurance coverage during that time. I called this morning to understand what this was and also to inquire about the bad debt claim to find out that they denied the claim due to not being responsible prior to XXXX. This morning, they basically said that it wasn't their fault, there was nothing they could do, I will be notified how much the insurance is for the lapsed period ( couldn't give me the price over the phone ) and that my only recourse would be to reach out to the "" old servicer. '' Last time I checked, I write the check to Homepoint, so me having to spend literally hours on this now going back and forth between the old servicer and new servicer is crazy to me. I will say the women I spoke with at the "" old servicer '' this morning was fantastic. I think she is the first person that understood what had happened. 

If they charge me for the missing gap of insurance, roughly $ XXXX {$400.00}, then this whole fiasco is going to cost me over {$1000.00} in total. 

I need some help/guidance on how to get some resolution to this. 

Thank you!

I had done research online in regards to the credibility of the organization, there is a website for the firm XXXX XXXX, which is a PI form out of XXXX XXXX, NV. I used the contact form on the web page and sent an inquiry with an image of the check and letter I had received. 

Today, the actual XXXX XXXX private investigator contacted me and told me the individuals named is not affiliated with their agency and the checking account is not one of their banking accounts. They suggest this is a scam. The letter instructions were intending to get me to purchase 4 XXXX gift cards with {$500.00} cash each, scratch off the silver banner on the back and send them photographs to prove I had completed the QA assignment. I was to purchase at one of the following stores XXXX of XXXX XXXX and then complete a form regarding my QA contact with the employees within the named organizations. I was instructed to withdraw {$2000.00} cash from the deposit of this check keep {$300.00} for my fee and the other {$130.00} would be used on a later assignment which I would receive instructions. The firm then began texting me to find out the second the check posted to my account to detail exactly what I was to do by item, although they had already sent instructions. They claim the person who had requested the QA was pressing them with a deadline. This caused me to be alerted to the possibility that they were not actually part of the organization so I sent a contact form to XXXX XXXX via the website, noting also that according to their site, they ask the people applying to obtain some sort of a card, probably security clearance. They notified me that they suspect fraud and that it is likely that once the person had the identifying information from the cards the check would likely bounce and I would be held liable for the {$2400.00} from my personal account. 
I did not provide these individuals with my banking information, but they do have my identifying information phone and email as well as my personal home address.",,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,AZ,85268,,Consent provided,Web,2018-06-14,Closed with explanation,Yes,,2936143

They had found a lien/second mortgage on the home. I was baffled and confused because they were aware of this and this was the whole purpose for the refinance. Not only that, they had already pulled the deed on the home 2 weeks before this and were aware. I was told by this supervisor that in order to make the refinance work I now needed to pay off this second mortgage to the tune of $ XXXX.

2024-04-26,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Inaccurate Reporting and Non-compliance with the FCRA Dear Sir or Madam, I am submitting this formal complaint against the credit reporting agencies TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX as well as the listed creditors and collection agencies. Despite detailed previous disputes and complaints, responses have often been inadequate, comprising pre-written standard form letters that fail to address the specific merits of each case. Such practices are not only unacceptable but also illegal, as they violate the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 1681i, requiring that each consumer dispute be addressed individually based on its particular merits.

My communications have been consistently disregarded, and there appears to be a systemic issue with how disputes are processed, often implying an illegal delay based on the erroneous assumption that they are third-party interventions. This is a direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), specifically Section 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), which mandates that all data included in a consumer 's file be accurately documented and validated.

I demand immediate and thorough validation of the following accounts, which reflect inaccuracies and unsubstantiated derogatory information : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Dispute : Unverified late payments, request for Metro 2 compliance in reporting. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account Number : XXXX Dispute : Incorrect reporting of payments, update required to reflect payments made on time. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Dispute : Charge-offs and late payments reported without proper documentation. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Dispute : Late payments inaccurately reported. 
XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Account Number : XXXX Dispute : Charge-off reported without substantiation. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Dispute : Incorrect charge-off and late payments. 
XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX Dispute : Charge-off and balance inaccuracies. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Account Numbers : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX Dispute : Multiple discrepancies in charge-off and payment history reports. 
These accounts reflect discrepancies that can not be overlooked, including duplicate reporting, unverified late payments, and charge-offs that significantly impact my creditworthiness. The accuracy of your credit reports is crucial, and the alleged discrepancies listed do not meet federal or state requirements for reporting and can not be substantiated. 

I kindly request that you handle this matter with the utmost care and diligence. Each account mentioned requires verification and validation, including the requisite certifiable Metro 2 Compliant Reporting Format Standards and processes related. If the claims can not be validated, they must be removed immediately from my credit report. Failure to process my requests promptly will compel me to consider legal action to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter. I expect a detailed response within the statutory timeframe. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",SC,295XX,,Consent provided,Web,2024-04-26,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,8863412

2024-04-30,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"Summary of complaint : On XXXX XXXX XXXX I opened a Chase checking and savings accounts using a coupon code. The coupon applies a bonus of {$300.00} for specific checking account conditions, {$200.00} for specific savings account conditions, and {$400.00} if both checking and savings conditions are met. I met the conditions for all three bonuses on XX/XX/2024. While Chase has paid the {$300.00} and {$200.00} bonuses, Chase has failed to pay the {$400.00} bonus by the date agreed. To rectify the situation, I called customer service, which resulted in inconsistent information and continually delayed follow-ups. Chase has failed to pay me {$400.00} according to their terms and conditions and has failed to resolve the situation in a timely manner. 

Timeline : XX/XX/2024 - I was approved for and opened Chase Total Checking and Chase Savings accounts using a coupon which was mailed to my address. A copy of the archived webpage listing the terms and conditions is attached ( Appendix A ). 

XX/XX/2024 - I deposited {$15000.00} of new money into the savings account within 30 days of coupon enrollment ( Appendix B ). 

XX/XX/2024 - I had {$250.00} from a paycheck deposited into the checking account by direct deposit within 90 days of coupon enrollment ( Appendix C ). On this date, the checking account bonus conditions were met. 

XX/XX/2024 - I received a {$300.00} bonus for fulfilling the checking account conditions ( Appendix C ). 

XX/XX/2024 - I received a {$200.00} bonus for fulfilling the savings account conditions ( Appendix B ). On this date, the savings account held {$15000.00} in new money for 90 days and the savings account bonus conditions were met. On this date, both the checking and savings account bonuses were met, qualifying me for the {$400.00} bonus, to be deposited within 15 days ( XX/XX/2024 ). 

XX/XX/2024 - I called Chase banking customer service ( XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX to inquire about the {$400.00} bonus, which had not yet been received. I was informed the bonus will be deposited on XX/XX/2024, when the {$15000.00} had been held in savings for 90 days. This statement has no factual basis in the timeline documented above. I did not attempt to resolve the incorrect date and decided to wait. 

XX/XX/2024 - I did not receive a {$400.00} bonus on this day for completing both the checking and savings accounts bonus conditions. 

XX/XX/2024 - I called Chase banking customer service ( XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX to inquire about the failure to deposit the {$400.00} bonus. The representative agreed the {$400.00} had failed to deposit and opened a case with the promotions team. No senior supervisor was available, so customer service advised me to call back in an hour. 

XX/XX/2024 - I called Chase banking customer service ( XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX  to talk to a senior supervisor. The supervisor informed me that a case had been opened and that I should receive a call back in XXXX business days. 

XX/XX/2024 - I did not receive a phone call from Chase after XXXX business days. I called Chase banking customer service ( XXXX ) at XXXX XXXX to inquire about the case. I was informed that the case was still in process and that I would receive a call back in XXXX weeks. 

XX/XX/2024 - I visited a local Chase bank branch at XXXX XXXX and spoke with a banker. The banker called Chase office and was informed that the {$400.00} bonus will be deposited on XX/XX/2024 when the {$15000.00} had been held for 90 days. After I informed the banker the date was incorrect, the Chase office then stated that the {$400.00} bonus will be deposited on XX/XX/2024 when the {$15000.00} had been held for 90 days.

I've attempted several times to ratify the issue with the original creditors and credit bureaus and they still reporting inaccurate, unverifiable information. I have disputed this item with the credit reporting agency and they reported you confirmed the account as valid. I honestly do not believe to ever have any relationship with this collection agency or original creditor. Also there are several inaccuracies with this account the way it's reporting and that's a total violation of FCRA and FDCPA laws and regulations. In a good faith effort to resolve the matter amicably, I must demand proof of this debt, specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature, as well as proof of your authority in this matter. Absent such proof, you must correct any erroneous reports of this past debt as mine. I am writing to request that you please provide the following information : 1. Please evidence your authorization under 15 USC 1692 ( e ) and 15 USC 1692 ( f ) in this alleged matter. 2. What is your authorization of law for your collection of information? 3.

Please evidence proof of the alleged debt, including the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature. 6. Please provide a complete account history, including any charges added for collection activity. 
You have 30 days upon receipt of this letter to provide strict proof of contract. In the event you can not provide strict proof of contract, you must cease and desist any and all collection efforts and immediately remove any derogatory information reported to the consumer reporting agencies. In addition, you will need to provide me your agreement, in writing, that you are closing your file, ceasing collecting activity, and deleting all information related to this reference number from any and all credit reports youve furnished the information to.

There was never a 1st attempt to serve notice of debt. So I decided to inquire what they thought I owe to them. The agent answered the phone and asked what my name was. I responded and she read me the miranda and said the call was being recorded. I responded and told her I was recording the call as well. She said she did not consent. I said it doesnt matter as I needed more information on the said debt they claimed I owe so the recording is for my personal use and I do not need her consent. She asked me for my mailing address after she said that they have an address of XXXX. I said I do not live there and have not lived there. I will not give her my mailing address because she had yet to provide a debt validation to me. Then she literally went off on me over the phone and cut me off while I was explaining why I did not want to provide that info. The call lasted for 4 minutes. I was shocked that is how a debt collector treats someone who they have not even verified a debt with. I urge anyone if anyone to request the tape of that call and please listen to it. So many violations on that call. I ended up hanging up and stating that I will file with the Attorney General which I did after the call. How else can a consumer get a debt verification if they freely called and get treated like that by a collection agent? I consider that a threatning act to force me to bite into a false unverified debt. I demand validation of said debt. I do not owe any debt to said debt collector.

Pardon me for starting a new complaint as you had closed the old : CPFB   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    Case  #  XXXX  Dea r Manager, Thank you for your prompt response. Unfortunately,   XXXX   XXXX   and LJ Ross asso ciates ( LJRA ) half-baked research and lackadaisical reporting lacks relevant points of facts :  1. That ou r property at   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  ,  XXXX , MD   XXXX   was a rental property. The renter had a separate  XXXX  account. However, when the renter moved out and much later the bank foreclosed on the property  XXXX  decided to purge that account and outstanding balance was merged into our current account on  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX ,  XXXX  MD  XXXX   ( p resent home ). {$910.00} was merged with latter account exactly on  XX/XX/XXXX  ( account history enclosed ).    2.  So when  XXXX  makes a claim that the utility bill is for present home she is condescending. Either she lives in a cave or below some rock to not realize how can some live on a property (  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   ), n ot pay utility bills and yet the utility company does NOT turn off the power. And why does the company not turn off power? Because bills are have been paid on time and the account is current.    3.  That  XXXX  fails to ask requisite questions on  XXXX  and blindly ascertains that  XXXX  bill is not included in the bankruptcy. She is again found stating falsely that utility bills are not for  XXXX  when the account history referred in para  XXXX  above highlights the falsehood.    4.   XXXX  without first getting hold of itemized statement from  XXXX  unabashedly goes on a charact er assassination c ampaign making false assumptions. While she is able to find out when bankruptcy was filed and  discharged but made no efforts to ascertain for what property? After all certain debts are discharged as result of bankruptcy, right! Had she done her job she would been pleasantly surprised? Easy  to destroy a poor consumer 's credit but tough to get relevant facts and details! Lo Behold! High handedness.   From the preceding it can safely be concluded that over-reaching and tone-deaf characteristics of collection agencies who are most concerned about their bottom-line and consider good-credit of customers as trivial hence expendable and  LJRA is no exception.    Regrettably, CPFB lacks the teeth to take such self-aggrandizing and disreputable collections agencies to task. Or is it? Thanks again for all the great service you extend. Best regards.

These items appear to be unverifiable, inaccurate, and questionable. Your agency has failed to ensure the accuracy of the information as required under 15 U.S. Code 1681e ( b ) Accuracy of Reports. This statute mandates that consumer reporting agencies must follow reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the information they report.

Furthermore, under 15 U.S. Code 1681i ( 5 ) Treatment of Inaccurate or Unverifiable Information, you are required to promptly delete or modify any information found to be inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable during a reinvestigation. If you are unable to provide me with verifiable proof of the accuracy of the disputed items within 15 days of your investigation, these accounts and the related information must be removed from my credit report.

I believe this reporting violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and the California Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies Act ( CCCRAA ) due to a lack of proper documentation and significant inconsistencies. 

**1. Insufficient Verification : ** In response to my request for debt verification, you provided an unsigned court document [ XXXX, XXXX Received ]. This document lacks the necessary signatures to constitute a legally binding court order, failing to meet the requirements for debt validation under 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( FDCPA ) and California Civil Code 1788 ( Rosenthal Act ). An unsigned document is insufficient proof of a legally valid debt. And I attached the court document and highlighted where the signatures will go to show clearly that there is no signature on this document from neither parent or non-custodial parent.

**2. Inconsistent Payment History : ** The reported payment history indicates consistent 120+ day late payments for years, despite the account balance supposedly being updated to {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. This discrepancy demonstrates a failure to accurately reflect the payment history and account status as required by 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ) ( FCRA ) and California Civil Code 1785.14 ( b ) ( CCCRAA ). 

**3. Discrepancy in Reported Balance : ** The reported balance fluctuates significantly without explanation. This lack of transparency and clarity violates the FCRA 's requirement for accurate and complete reporting ( 15 U.S.C. 1681g ( a ) ( 1 ) ). 

**4. Other Credit Bureaus : ** XXXX and XXXX have already removed this account from my credit report due to the lack of verifiable documentation. TransUnion 's continued reporting based on an unsigned document highlights a clear discrepancy and further supports the invalidity of this account. 

I demand the immediate removal of this inaccurate account from my credit report. I request that TransUnion provide a certified copy of a *signed* court order and other legally sufficient documentation that validates this debt. Without such evidence, the continued reporting of this debt constitutes a violation of the FCRA and CCCRAA.

The credit card that I'm speaking about is a ulta credit card, I will leave he numbers at the end of his message. I discovered a fraudulent use on my ulta CC after looking at my credit report on XXXX XXXX. My husband pays the bills '', he would pay all bills with a flat amount mostly above and beyond to pay cc off quickly. Bill pay is automatically set up. Please see statements. I called and spoke with customer service, twice in 3 days. I wanted an answer as to "" why We have NEVER Received statements for this credit card '', what was charged on this card? Why is there only late fees and interest as charges? They could not give me an answer, I filed a dispute. I reported this card as fraudulent not my charges and paid in full ( over two years ago ) Unfortunately, my husbands mistakably continued to pay it. Lastly, asked OCC to remove a late 30day on my credit report. Also, in XXXX I went on line and registered for on line statements, I went as far back as the online statements would allow and there is nothing but late charges and interest. After four months of waiting for a response I called the credit card company to ask about the payment I didn't want another 30 day late on my credit report. And I wanted to know the resolution of the dispute. At this point when I called the credit card company, I was given the runaround, they said I needed to speak to a different department and when they would transfer me they would hang up on me. This went on for about two weeks, finally I called and asked for the manager and I demanded an answer. I was told that they did not approve the dispute because I had filed for a bankruptcy back in XXXX? I said that has nothing to do with this fraudulent credit card. They said I had to continue paying and they would not take off the 30 day late. I desperately need help in this situation please let me know if you have any other questions. They have never sent me a written report. I am requesting all my money back from the overpayment of a paid off credit card and the fraudulent charges on the credit card removed.

I jointly applied for the mortgage together with ex-spouse in XXXX, we both signed for the loan, I am on the Deed as well. 
I have since XX/XX/XXXX had issues with not recieving information, and refunds of escrow overage, regarding the loan. I requested documents such as Principal paid on property in XX/XX/XXXX - wasn't received, I requested all mailed information regarding loan to be mailed to the porperty address of the loan, was never done. I was informed it was mailed out, but only to the co-signor my ex-spouse they said the could not mail it to me. In XX/XX/XXXX I contacted TD Bankregarding the escrow account and the recalculation of taxes, and was after much struggle informed that an overage check ( {$1000.00} ) was mailed out to the ex-spous 's address, made out to us both that he cashed in. Even though I explained the entire situation and which you can clearly be seen in the payment history that I have been the only person paying the mortgage since the forementioned date. The bank again refused to help. XX/XX/XXXX I logged into to my mortgage account to discover that my mortgage payment has increased by {$260.00} / month due to insufficient funds in the escrow account. I contacted the bank immediately asking as to why I was not informed of this. They stated information had been sent out in XX/XX/XXXX. I, of course never received this information. I asked why, they said that it was sent to just the ex-spouse 's address. I contacted TD Bank via email, phone, and XXXX regarding this, and am still waiting on a call back from their escalations team. I have spoken to their escalations team in the past and nothing has ever been resolved. Why is the bank allowed to treat me so inequal to the other loaner?

I believe that there have been inaccuracies and errors on my credit report that are negatively impacting my credit score and financial well-being. 

Below, I am providing you with a summary of the issues I have encountered : I have repeatedly tried to correct the inaccurate late open accounts listed on my credit report. These late open accounts are not reflective of my actual credit history, and I have never been late on any open accounts. Despite my diligent efforts to rectify this issue, it persists, affecting my ability to access credit and other financial opportunities. 
Additionally, I have been working tirelessly to have the charge-off account removed from my credit report. This charge-off account does not accurately represent my financial history, and I believe it is an erroneous entry on my credit report. I have provided the necessary documentation and information to prove that this account should not be considered a charge-off, yet it remains on my report, causing severe harm to my creditworthiness. 

I have made numerous attempts to resolve these issues by contacting the respective creditors, submitting dispute letters, and providing supporting documents, but there has been little to no response or resolution from your end. I understand that accuracy in credit reporting is crucial, and I am committed to maintaining my financial integrity. 

I kindly request your immediate attention and action in investigating these inaccuracies on my credit report. I expect a thorough review of the information I have submitted and prompt correction of these errors. I also request that you provide me with written updates on the progress of this dispute and the results of your investigation. 

Furthermore, I am aware of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), and I am prepared to take any necessary legal actions if these discrepancies are not resolved in a timely manner. It is my hope that such actions will not be required, and we can work together to rectify these inaccuracies promptly. I am asking for your assistance to correct or remove the accounts : XXXX XXXX Balance Owed : {$6700.00} Date Opened : XX/XX/2020 I do not believe I was late on the dates you are reporting.

2022-07-31,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"Dear Sir/Madam Re : Request for Review of Approved Mortgage Relief Option : Reference : XXXX XXXX XXXX Property Address : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NY XXXX ; XXXX Loan # XXXX Reference the above approved mortgage relief options attached. For the avoidance of doubt, the XXXX retention option applied by XXXX XXXX XXXX al in 2016 which was applied by XXXX XXXX, the loan servicer then, before the loan was transferred to SLS are given below : 1. SLS did not use the information given by borrower to evaluate the modification contrary to RESPA and the CONSENT ORDER SLS signed recently with CFPB, but rather introduced some strange figures like TOTAL MONTHLY EXPENSES OF {$350.00} and XXXX TOTAL MONTHLY GROSS INCOME in order to generate the results which includes balloon payment of {$480000.00} to the loan structure ( See Exhibit 2B attached ) 2. SLS approved mortgage relief did not provide any change in the terms of the original mortgage like the interest rate remains at 4.575 % ) and number of years ( maturity remains at 30 years ) as per loan modification prescription. 

3.Before the modification, the loan structure ( See Exhibit 2A attached ) consists : Interest Rate : 4.575 %, Maturity : 30 Years ; Total Payment Amount ( P & I+ Escrow ) of {$4300.00} + Principal Balance of {$460000.00} + Zero interest deferred amount of {$140000.00} + Arrears of {$180000.00}. 

Total loan Amount of {$710000.00} 4..After Your Modification as per your approval, the loan structure now consists : Interest Rate : 4.575 %, Maturity : 30 Years ; Total Payment Amount ( P & I+ Escrow ) of {$3800.00} + Principal Balance of {$710000.00} + XXXX Principal of 4.575 % interest of {$130000.00} + Balloon Amount of {$480000.00}. ( See Exhibit 2A attached ) Total loan Amount of {>= $1,000,000} 5. From the above, it is clear that no mortgage relief has been provided, but additional burden of {$730000.00} ( that is balloon amount of {>= $1,000,000} + zero interest deferred amount now converted to a 4.575 % interest current loan of {$250000.00} of 13 years term ) 6. Also bifurcating the 2nd interest free unpaid principal into 2 parts : a ) interest free portion b ) interest bearing portion violates the extant modification agreement signed with XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. 

7. Some provisions in this modification approval violates the provisions of the original mortgage Note and the Modification Agreement. Please note, that the terms of the loan or servicing guidelines are not to be changed according to Federal Laws when a loan is transferred in the secondary market. 

8.Your extant response to Cfpb indicates that you applied some Investors Guidelines, which remain unclear, which is a violation of the originating loan agreement, the extant modification agreement, RESPA and extant Federal and New York State laws and servicing guidelines. 

9.The loan is a XXXX Bank loan from a XXXX XXXX XXXX and not anInvestor loan. 

In view of the foregoing, I am submitting a new modification application; and appealing that SLS reviews the approved retention as per RESPA and the CONSENT ORDER SLS signed recently with CFPB. 

Thank you for the expedited action.

Policy states According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy. Reinvestigations of Disputed Information 1. Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection ( f ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C 1681-1681y, imposes responsibilities on all persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRAs ). These responsibilities are found in Section 623 of the FCRA, 15 U.S.C 1681s-2. State law may impose additional requirements on furnishers. All furnishers of information to CRAs should become familiar with the applicable laws and may want to consult with their counsel to ensure that they are in compliance. General Prohibition on Reporting Inaccurate Information The FCRA prohibits information furnishers from providing information to a CRA that they know or have reasonable cause to believe is inaccurate. However, the furnisher is not subject to this general prohibition if it clearly and conspicuously specifies an address to which consumers may write to notify the furnisher that certain information is inaccurate. Sections 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) and ( a ) ( 1 ) ( C ). Duty to Correct and Update Information If at any time a person who regularly and in the ordinary course of business furnishes information to one or more CRAs determines that the information provided is not complete or accurate, the furnisher must promptly provide complete and accurate information to the CRA. In addition, the furnisher must notify all CRAs that received the information of any corrections, and must thereafter report only the complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). Duties After Notice of Dispute from Consumer If a consumer notifies a furnisher, at an address specified for the furnisher for such notices, that specific information is inaccurate, and the information is, in fact, inaccurate, the furnisher must thereafter report the correct information to CRAs. Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( B ). If a consumer notifies a furnisher that the consumer disputes the completeness or accuracy of any information reported by the furnisher, the furnisher may not subsequently report that information to a CRA without providing notice of the dispute. Section 623 ( a ) ( 3 ). All furnishers must have in place reasonable procedures to respond to notifications from CRAs that information furnished is the result of identity theft, and to prevent refurnishing the information in the future. A furnisher may not furnish information that a consumer has identified as resulting from identity theft unless the furnisher subsequently knows or is informed by the consumer that the information is correct. Section 623 ( a ) ( 6 ). If a furnisher learns that it has furnished inaccurate information due to identity theft, it must notify each CRA of the correct information and must thereafter report only complete and accurate information. Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ). When any : furnisher of information is notified pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 605B that a debt has resulted from identity theft, the furnisher many not sell, transfer, or place for collection the debt except in certain limited circumstances.

XXXX paid Ally bank {$12000.00} the book value of the car, Ally than made a claim to the gap insurer of {$4400.00} The full amount was paid by XXXX. I called Ally spoke to someone in customer service to confirm they received both payments and was advised yes and told "" do n't worry XXXX the loan is PIF "" I never received any additional monthly statements after that until 4 months later in XX/XX/2014 I received a letter from Ally claiming I was in default of my loan and that {$290.00} was 120 days past due. When I called Ally Bank to find out what this was about they told me that the GAP insurance did not cover the late charges when I asked what months and amounts were the late charges for after holding for 19 minutes the girl said there are NO late charges on the loan and see transferred me to the asset recovery unit after explaining the entire story all over he said I do n't have anything to do with your car it is not out for Repo ( NO KIDDING ) I called back and asked to speak with a manger and told that woman the entire story all over again and she said "" well the gap insurance did not pay what they were supposed to "" they never do '' I called the gap insurer and confirmed they paid the exact amount demanded from Ally Bankd {$4400.00}.

I have contacted Ally Bank and the collection agency they hired server times but as I said I 'm still waiting for a call back. clearly they put the insurance funds in some type of suspense account rather than apply them to the loan which caused additional interest to accrue until they reconciled the account.

On XX/XX/XXXX, the bank had confirmed that they have a complete package, therefore bearing the 37 days threshold. I was further advised that the underwriter may request other documents during the process if needed. Contribution letter and paystubs from the contributor were requested and sent immediately upon the request. The underwriter then asked for a lease to be completed. When I spoke to XXXX at the bank, he said the lease for the amount of {$900.00} is not complete. XXXX tried fi find XXXX reason the underwriter said that, by examining every page of that lease. He then said its the tenants initials that were missing on page 5 of that lease. I immediately obtained the initials and sent back. XXXX had said it was the last piece of document they were requesting. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. I called in the same day, AND also the day after New Years Day. and it was confirmed as recieved. 

Fast forward to today XX/XX/XXXX, when I called in just to make sure things were moving, and was told nothing is being processed because we are within 16 days to sheriff sale, and the underwriter was asking for something else he FAILED to request when he indicated that the initial on the lease was the last thing he needed! Please note i sent in the last document on XX/XX/XXXX and it was confirmed as recieved. 

Underwriter failed to request specifically what he needed, so kept on asking for docs that obviously didnt satisfy the issue he had, which up until this minute, we havd no idea what that is.

I have been deeply affected by these violations, both financially and emotionally. The unauthorized credit pulls have led to unwarranted credit score reductions, obstructing my ability to secure favorable loans and housing. The unverified accounts and inaccuracies in my personal information have caused immense distress, affecting my mental well-being and adding undue hardship to my daily life. 

Given the profound impact these violations have had on my life, I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau intervene and enforce my legal rights. I implore you to take the necessary measures to hold these creditors accountable for their actions and ensure the rectification of my credit report in compliance with the law. 

I am seeking the following remedies : A thorough investigation into the unauthorized credit pulls and unverified accounts listed above. 
The enforcement of appropriate penalties against the creditors found to be in violation of consumer protection laws. 
A directive to the involved creditors to expeditiously remove any unverified accounts from my credit report. 
Facilitation of the correction of any inaccuracies in my personal information. 
I trust that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's commitment to safeguarding consumers ' rights will lead to a just resolution of this matter. Please consider the profound implications these violations have had on my life and act to rectify the situation. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I anticipate a timely resolution and equitable outcome. Should you require additional information or supporting documentation, please feel free to contact me at [ Your Phone Number ] or [ Your Email Address ].

He was checking his banking at XXXX XXXX  and saw a pending withdrawal for {$1200.00} for Suntrust Bank. We thought we had missed a mortgage payment and added money from savings to checking to cover our $ 2093 monthly mortgage. I remembered that I had received an email on XX/XX/2019 ( approximate date ) saying they had received our mortgage payment and applied it. We were two hours from home. I attempted to call Suntrust over FIVE TIMES ... with wait times equaling over two hours ... I was shifted from department to department when I finally got a human on the phone. No one could find the XXXX that is attempting to be taken out of our checking account..and then the additional funds we transferred from savings to checking was being grabbed by Suntrust also. As soon as we got near home we went to XXXX XXXX  to stop payment on the {$2000.00} total. We were told because it was so late in the afternoon they weren't sure they could stop payment. 
Suntrust ... as far as we can tell ... .insists they aren't taking money out. We have never authorized payments to come out of our accounts and use the bill pay feature when we have a mortgage payment due.

I called bank of america immediately to report it as a fraudulant charge. I spoke with a gentleman who stated the charge would no longer be on my account in 48-72 hours and he issued me a new debit card which he said I would receive in 5-7 business days. I checked my bank today XX/XX/XXXX and the charge had processed, I called bank of america again to report this issue and the first woman I spoke with had me on hold approximately 15 minutes while she looked into this and then told me she would need to transfer me to a different department. She transferred my call and I was then speaking with a woman named XXXX I gave all of my information to her all over again and she said it appeared that my claim had not been processed, and she needed to put me on hold to check if she could find the existing claim or needed to submit a new one, but instead my call was somehow transferred so I once again gave all of my information and explained the situation and explained that XXXX believed my claim had not been submitted as it should have, this woman stated that I just needed to wait to hear back from their fraud department, even though multiple times I tried to explain what XXXX had said about my claim not possibly being submitted. I asked to speak to a supervisor she told me that no one was available and that she could take my number and have someone call me back in 30-40 minutes it has been an hour and 20 minutes and I still have not received a call back from bank of america or a call from their fraud department. I ended up calling XXXX myself and explained the situation. They confirmed it was indeed a fraudulant charge and the item purchased for {$96.00} had been mailed to a Florida address, and I do not live in Florida or even know anyone there.

2018-12-26,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Opening an account,Didn't receive terms that were advertised,"In response to a bonus offer of {$400.00} for opening a new checking account and funding with {$15000.00} and opening a savings account within 30 days of opening the account and then maintaining the balances for 60 days, within 90 days of these terms being met, the deposit of {$400.00} was to be released to the checking account. FYI, my husband opened an account at the same time as me and had the exact same problem. He ultimately was able to get them to review the account AFTER 12 phone calls and numerous threats of filing legal action against Citibank, and they finally released the bonus. 

I opened my account with Citibank on XX/XX/2018 and funded my Citibank checking account on XX/XX/2018 with {$15000.00}. I also funded my Citibank savings account with {$100.00} on the same day. These funds are still there and have been there untouched since XX/XX/XXXX. 

I contacted Citibank 7 times by telephone regarding this matter. Most of the times I did not record a customer service agent name because they claimed my account had met the terms and the bonus was being processed and would be released within a few days. By XX/XX/2018 I was fed up with their lies and asked for a supervisor. I spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. He apologized many times telling me that I had indeed met the terms of the offer and he didn't know why it was taking so long. He put me on hold for a long time while he said he was talking with the bonus department. When he returned to the call he said they told him it was being processed and the problem was they were overloaded with bonus accounts and it was taking longer than expected. He said to give them 5 business days and it should be in the account. 
I was out of the country for most of XXXX and when I returned, still no bonus or communications from this terrible deceitful organization. I called yet again for the 7th time on XX/XX/XXXX. Immediately upon the customer service agent answering I demanded to speak to a manager. I was transferred to XXXX. I went through the issue again with all details. XXXX looks at the account and tells me all the agents before me told me the wrong information. He now said that I needed to meet the requirements within 30 days of opening the account - which I did. He then said I needed to maintain the balances for 60 days - which I did. He then said Citibank has the option to wait the full 90 days after that before they had to pay the bonus, but usually pay it sooner - apparently not in my case. He now told me that the bonus was due, according to his "" math '', on XX/XX/18. After that he said they were definitely out of terms. I was absolutely fed up and demanded to open a case dispute. He refused. He said, sorry but since Citibank is not out terms yet, I can't open a dispute. 
So I waited until XX/XX/XXXX - no bonus. It is now XX/XX/XXXX - no bonus. 
I can not continue to waste my valuable time trying to get this awful company to live up to their published offer. As I said, it took my husband 12 phone calls and the threat of getting an attorney to get them to complete the transaction. I am not interested in speaking with them again, banking with them, or quite frankly ever seeing the name Citibank ever again either. I want my bonus as I met the contractual requirements of their published offer and then I will be immediately closing my account and NEVER bank with them again.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",CA,92108,,Consent provided,Web,2018-12-26,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,3110013

I went XXXX  for work shortly after for 4 years, came back to the U.S. In XXXX I notice my credit score had dropped to below XXXX. The military star card was used by my ex wife, military star card did not close the account as required. I contacted military star card and asked them to cancel the card, close the account, they only sent the original documents and nothing else, they also refused, did not close the account. 

Once again, this last month, my ex wife has been delinquent in her charges and caused my credit to slip. 
This is absolutely wrong. Military Star did not follow their obligations to close this account, and initially you have refused to look into this. Your my resource for issues such as this. Cant you at least contact Military Star card The Exchange Credit Program and have them have my wife keep her own account and free me from this?

The agreement was for XXXX dollars a month for 12 months. I paid on time and completed the agreement. Since the time that I started the account, I have changed emails, phone numbers and I do not have access to the old Kikoff because when I was done I deleted the app. They continue to charge my bank account XXXX dollars which is XXXX dollars more than what I was paying before after I was done with the one year agreement.. I did not notice they were still charging my account until I switch banks, and Kikoff reported I was over 30 days late. I finished my 12 months XXXX dollars a month agreement and they continued the account after I completed it and increase the amount to XXXX dollars. It is not about the money I have money, but I had a perfect payment history for the last XXXX years of trying to build my credit and now I have a late payment 30 and 60 days more because I can not make a complaint with Kikoff directly because I no longer have access to my old phone email or app information and when you go on to their site to complain they want a account number for you to submit a ticket for a complaint. So I cant resolve it through them. I contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX and Kikoff repeatedly sends the same that they are legally obligated to report the correct information and they are not responding to my particular situation. Theyre giving a generic response.. I dont see how they can charge me for being late when they kept the account going for longer than I agreed when I finish the one year and close the account. So I have no way of logging in for a complaint. I have no way of talking to a real person at Kikoff, and they have now made my credit go down for late payments when I had a perfect credit history for the last XXXX years. It is ridiculous that you can not reach anyone or do anything when you are locked out and have none of the same information you had when you open the account year or more prior. I would like them to remove this from my credit history because I have not missed any payments on any of my bills. I have a good income and I do not care about paying a little XXXX dollars a month but I do care about them, being con artist, and charging me after my account was complete. Without my knowledge I just did not realize it until I switch banks, and they no longer were able to take the money out without me realizing, somebody needs to stop this and I need this handled",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Kikoff Inc.,SC,29687,,Consent provided,Web,2023-12-19,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,8025443

There are many New Yorkers that depend on their landline not cell phone. The reason for this is my cell phone connection is horrible. This is why I set up my Santander alert messages with my email account. 
The last statement sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX from Santander manager "" XXXX XXXX '' is inaccurate and fraudulent. I will go to the Attorney General if need to be! 
My negative XXXX $ was taken out of my account with no alert prior to the transaction. Because of this I was not able to pay my XX/XX/XXXX rent. Furthermore, to say I did not get a phone alert is preposterous and to say I did not set up an account until after this transaction is unethical. 
Yes, I set up cell phone alerts! But, I stated to the representative I will still pursue this unethical issue "" regardless '' even after SHE requested for me to program cell phone bank alerts. 
But, this is her job to skillfully misrepresent information to impoverished account holders. 
It will be helpful and can prevent this type of issue from happening in the near future. 

Yes, for people that depend on their cell phone for daily usage and daily transactions. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX I am not one to use a cell phone only to send a message sporadically. 
The bank is penalizing me because I did not set up alerts via cell phone? 
The bank did not email my alerts electronically. 
For 2 years I utilize my checking account because my checking account is what I use for all my transactions Now, I have to be penalized because this bank did not send me an alert to my email. This is preposterous. Banks are in a financial crises since and before this pandemic! Because of financial opportunities swindling funds from low-income consumers is on a rise and it is misfortunate banking electronical systems are adequately responsible. 
The last ( this is my 3rd request for reconnaissance of my funds ) memo I received from XXXX XXXX XXXX has to be investigated. 
Can you review her statements in paragraph 3 and 4? I check my statements and the amount of money I have in my checking account to cover the check!! 
I have to because I am on a fixed income. 
I can not afford to hand over XXXX $ cash free to a bank for there profit. 
In her memo XXXX XXXX claims XXXX was refunded to a negative {$740.00} I only had XXXX in my account. She says the electronic system does not verify -negative transactions. Yet, the automatic system will pay for the XXXX $ check. 
A negative XXXX XXXX How did the their electronic banking system know in a few days my XXXX check will be in my checking account. The Santander banking system recognized my deposit on the 3rd and automatically penalized me for XXXX $!!! 
This transaction was set up to get XXXX $ cash free!!! This is the last document received from XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. A copy of this document is attached to this complaint following previous documents I sent in the last 2 complaints. Regarding this banks aggravating service towards me.

Its very obvious that your agency doesnt know what the FCRA is because from the looks of my credit report and all the errors i see you are disregarding it so heres my breakdown. 

1. The Fair Credit Reporting Act is the primary federal law that governs the collection and reporting of credit information about consumers. Its rules cover how a consumer 's credit information is obtained, how long it is kept, and how it is shared with othersincluding consumers themselves.

2.What is a FCRA violation?

Creditors give reporting agencies inaccurate financial information about you. Reporting agencies mixing up one person 's information with another 's because of similar ( or same ) last name or social security number. Agencies fail to follow guidelines for handling disputes.

3.My rights under the fair credit reporting act Verify the accuracy of my report when it is required for employment purposes.

Receive notification if information in my file has been used against me in applying for credit or other transactions.

Disputeand have the bureaus correct and deleteinformation in my report that I incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable.

Remove outdated, negative information ( after seven years in most cases, 10 in the case of bankruptcy ).

I demand these items be deleted immediately. I entered the items and the outcome I desire below because you are in violation and these items are not 100 % accurate and they are either INACCURATE, Unverifiable or Invalidated. I recently applied for extended credit and was denied I am in distress because of your mistakes.

The law is very clear as to the civil liability and the remedy available to me ( Section 616 & 617 ) if you fail to comply with Federal Law. I am a litigious consumer and fully intend on pursuing litigation in this matter to enforce my rights under the FCRA.

I am able to fight this but what about the elderly and the infirm who depend on these products or services and are taken advantage of by this type of financing for alleged debts. I do think this is an unfair practice for all consumers. This builds distrust.

The representative that took my call informed me at the end of the call to be on the lookout for an email from the Credit Union and to be certain to respond to the email. I did receive the aforementioned email on XX/XX/2019 requesting any supporting documents and/or information and stating that I submit the information by XX/XX/2019. I sent several items along with my response on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX. In the email was this paragraph, If you have any questions regarding this matter or to submit the requested documentation, you may reply to this email or call us toll free anytime at XXXX. If you prefer, you may send us a secure message online at navyfederal.orgvia our Online Banking service or write to Navy Federal Credit Union, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, VA XXXX. You may also reach us by fax at XXXX. Sincerely, Debit Card Dispute Resolution So, I replied to the email at XXXX XXXX. However, your staff keep accusing me of not responding to the email which is not true. I called on XX/XX/2019 after noticing that the temporary credit was reversed. I did not receive any communication from Navy Federal regarding this decision. I called and finally spoke with XXXX who identified himself as a supervisor in the Frauds Department. He took the time to research my account and determined that I had sent the email and requested information and put the credit back in place. He also noticed that the reversal was done prior to your close of business. Again, I received no communication from Navy Federal Credit Union but this credit was also reversed. 
I called again on XX/XX/2019 and told rather than asked that I had not responded to the emails sent to me. This is not true I originally responded on XX/XX/XXXX, I called on XX/XX/XXXX, and again on XX/XX/XXXX. No one from the credit union has once asked me for a copy of the email and attachments I sent prior to XX/XX/2019. The assumption is that I the member with a lower balance account is lying. I believe your staff believe that if they continue to ignore me, continue to be rude to me when I call, that I will go away and that is not an option! Certain members of your staff have been downright rude, nasty and very antagonistic. No one has attempted to resolve my issue. 
I have done everything that has been requested of me. With the email being ambiguous at the least I should have been given the benefit of the doubt and asked to send the information again. Not have an ambiguous email and penalize me for what you are sending out. 
For the record I do believe that if I were of a different persuasion with a larger balance in my account I would not be in this position. I am seeking a full refund of the unauthorized charge, along with the {$40.00} Oops credit line fees credited back to my account.

2022-11-02,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"I became aware of this "" joint '' account, with SYNCB/JCPENNY, when my XXXX  score took a hit in the fall of last year ( XXXX ). I checked my score with XXXX and found out it was due to a "" joint '' account opened by an ex-spouse on XX/XX/XXXX. Payments had quit being made and they closed the account around XXXX of XXXX and made it a charge off I believe during the fall of XXXX. ( Not sure of exact dates, unable to locate in my XXXX XXXX XXXX report ) I contacted my ex and asked about the card. She explained that she had money problems and had to file bankruptcy. I told her that by having my name on the account that her not paying her debts had hit my XXXX  score. She replied that it hadn't hurt hers. 
I filed a dispute with XXXX and XXXX. I checked back later and found that Synchrony Bank had verified the account as being mine. 
I then had numerous conversations with the bank, they still say it's my account. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I sent the bank a certified/signature confirmation letter and received the confirmation showing they received the letter XX/XX/XXXX. 
In the letter I explained that I have been divorced from my ex since XXXX and had not lived at or received any mail at her address since then. I also provided them with my current address and explained that this has been my address since XXXX. 
I also stated that, per the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I was requesting copies of any and all documentation that they had used to verify the information they had sent to the credit reporting agencies. I also requested copies of any and all applications or documents showing that I had applied for and signed to open this account. I also advised that it was my understanding that they had 30 days to comply with my request or to have this item removed from my credit report. 
The bank sent me a letter, ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) addressed to my ex and myself, ( now that they had MY address ), stating that they were opening a fraud investigation. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX about their investigation and was told I would be receiving fraud investigation forms and that I had to fill them out and get them sent back by XX/XX/XXXX, or the investigation would be dropped. 
I then received another letter from the bank dated XX/XX/XXXX. It stated that the claim review was complete and they found that the payments had been made by me, the account had been opened more than 12 months with statements sent to me and that I had authorized, participated in or benefited from the purchase. 
I immediately called the phone number they provided in their letter. I again explained that I had never made a payment, received a bill or benefited from their credit card. I again advised that the "" joint '' account with my ex was opened 23 years after our divorce, and I hadn't received any mail at her address since XXXX. I was advised they would reopen the investigation. 
I called the bank again on XX/XX/XXXX and asked if they had acted on my Fair Credit Reporting Act request dated XX/XX/XXXX, received by them XX/XX/XXXX. She advised that they had 60 days to act on it, and that I would be hearing from them. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called the bank again and asked where they were with my request per the FCRA, and he said he couldn't find it. So I provided him with the date and the name of the person that had signed for it. He looked some more and sad he couldn't find it. So I said that I paid close to {$8.00} to send a letter to them and it was lost. He said that it wasn't lost, he just couldn't find it. I asked if he could explain the difference and he didn't respond. 
He then told me that he would be sending me an affidavit to be filled out and signed by me to start a fraud investigation. I explained that an investigation was ongoing and I really didn't care about their investigation, I wanted some action on my FCRA request. He again stated that he couldn't find it and would be sending the forms. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received the forms and they were the exact same forms that I filled out and returned to them in XXXX. 
I called the bank on XX/XX/XXXX and after more than 2 hours and speaking with or being disconnected from at least 6 different people, no one could help.

( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block.

What happened is I now have a total of nine inquiries ( 3 per bureau ) instead of them being considered as one inquiry per Buereau which artificially inflates the quantity of inquiries by 9 overall instead of one time per bureau for a total of 9 inquiries.

So I keep getting denied credit for a mortgage or credit cards for having to many inquiries. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX our home was damaged by the tornado on that date in XXXX TX and we needed the loan for repairs. 

XXXX XXXX required a middle FICO score minimum of 680 and I had a 679 and they refused to waive the one point. They insisted these hard inquiries would be considered as one hard inquiry per Bureau. 

So our home almost a year later remains unrepaired because I still can't qualify due to the amount of inquiries and they say they can't ( wont ) request the correction. 

Factual Data tells me they won't request a correction either. The pulls are dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

Please help as our livingroom exterior wall and roof are exposed to the elements ( roof is tarped ) and I can't qualify for the financial resources for repairs.

Appreciate anything you can do for Factual Data to do the right thing. The reason for pulls given by Factual Data in my credit reports is only listed purpose as for a mortgage to only XXXX for all 3 times but XXXX  counts them as 3 times, not one anyway.

Factual Data listed the pulls for the other two bureaus as Miscellaneous Rplg. Agencies. Not as being for a mortgage.

I had a problem getting the funds by that date due to the fact that I had to pay my rent and utilities since I am in the process of retiring those things were my priority, so on XX/XX/XXXX i called the company to see if i could pay it on that day. I spoke to the account rep XXXX and he said he would not accept it that I could pay the full monthly payment amount and the he could look at deferring XX/XX/XXXX payment. During the conversation he was rude and i felt harassed and pressured because he said to me something to the fact well you are 31 days past due and it can be reported to your credit bureau and isn't the car important to you. I told him no keeping a roof over my head is more important, so he said well what if we just come pick it up between XXXX and XXXX. I told him to let me know and i would get my stuff out and he could have it. He then said to me well you seem frustrated because you are talking over me I said to him no I am in a hurry to get to work and he kept on with you seem frustrated. He then began to say well he will give me a few days to think about it and follow up with me and he hung up on me. Later that night on XX/XX/XXXX a lady by the name of XXXX called me and we discussed what had happened between XXXX and myself, she said that her manager told her to follow up with me to see what they could do to help,, short of it she was willing to defer the payment and take the {$50.00} with it due by XX/XX/XXXX and a full payment by XX/XX/XXXX. I informed her that I no longer wish to be contacted by XXXX. She said that she would note my file and asked if she could call me on his behalf I said yes, but did not wish to be contacted by him again. Well long story short today XX/XX/XXXX i got a text msg from XXXX at XXXX XXXX my time and that is clearly a violation of the FDCPA.

Recently we purchased a new dryer, if we would have used our debit card, there would have been a 4 % charge added for the swipe fee. We purchased new tires for a vehicle, again, 4 % charge to use the debit card. Fortunately with both, we wrote checks to avoid the charge. 
Now seriously what is this fee for and who does it go to? If you consider a full day of business sales, and most consumers use debit or credit cards, each purchase is charged 3.5 - 10 %? They are making in millions of dollars a day. Come on, why has nothing been done about this? For credit cards, consumers pay an outrageous amount for interest fees ( if there is a balance month to month ), is that not enough? Big box stores are paying way less than small businesses also. Whats up with that? 
Please put some focus on this issue. Paying with cash is not the answer. I don't believe when paying cash all businesses claim cash purchases. XXXXXXXX XXXX will not take cash so you really have no choice to pay with debit or credit card + this swipe fee. This is just a horrible thing that is happening to the consumers. 
Again, please put some focus on this! We the people need a break from this nonsense.

I did not authorize this transaction. I began to research where this transaction  may h ave came from and I noticed it was credited to my mother 's checking account. I contacted my mother and she verbalized she did not make this transaction nor is she allowed to. I contacted  Capital One  customer service and spoken with a representative who instructed me to have my mother contact them because the transaction was made to her account due to her account being overdraft. The representative stated once my mother contacted them the transaction would be reversed. I, then, contacted my mother and contacted  Capital One  customer service with my mother on the other line. We provided a new representative with our information when she then provided us with different information from what the first representative stated. She stated  Capital One has the right to take from any account with my mo ther 's name attached in order to make her account positive. My mother and I verbalized to the representative that this have never happen during the longevity of our membership with  Capital One.  The representative became very irate and began to practically yell at us the right of  Capital One to take from  a account. The representative was quite rude to my mother when my mother pulled up her policy disclosure stating, "" If we mistakenly credit your account for funds to which you are not the rightful owner, we  may  deduct funds from your account, even if this causes your account to be overdraft. We  may do so at any time and without prior notice to you. '' My mother is not the rightful owner of the funds  taken out of my account.

2023-10-16,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Managing an account,Deposits and withdrawals,"I opened a Laurel Road ( owned by Key Bank ) Loyalty Checking account on 2023 XX/XX/XXXX. Shortly after applying and being approved for said checking account, I listed it as my primary direct deposit account with my new employer. Then after setting up my online account access, I enrolled two ( 2 ) external accounts for external transfers - one is my XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and the other is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was enrolled without any issueXXXX XXXX XXXX  got flagged by their fraud department, hence, without even contacting me to verify that I did enroll XXXX XXXX, Laurel Road 's fraud department went ahead and restricted my account access as a result of one of my external accounts being flagged in the system. The restriction on my Laurel Road Loyalty Checking account was initiated on Tuesday, 2023 XX/XX/XXXX. By this time, my first paycheck with my new employer had deposited already but my funds were restricted/frozen/unaccessible for me to use as a result of their system flagging my account for fraud due to me adding an external account for transfer. I didn't find out my account was restricted until Wednesday, 2023 XX/XX/XXXX when I tried to log online to my account and noticed the restriction message and that I couldn't log into my account. I was also contacted by XXXX XXXX ( one of the Customer Service supervisors ) late afternoon on Wednesday, 2023 XX/XX/XXXX whereby he left a message related to the restriction. I spoke with customer service on Thursday, 2023 XX/XX/XXXX to discuss what the issue was with my account and that's when I was informed that my account was restricted due to the external account that I myself added. 

Anyhow, I was informed that I needed to send documentation verifying that I was the owner of the external account ( XXXX XXXX ) that I added to my Laurel Road Loyalty Checking account. So, in the subsequent days following Thursday, 2023 XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted several documentation - three ( 3 ) months of bank statements, a Form 1099 for the IRS and an official account ownership letter from XXXX XXXX to prove to the fraud department at Laurel Road that I am the legitimate account owner of the XXXX XXXX  account. 

I have tried to contact Laurel Road almost on a daily basis to inquire as to the status of my fraud department 's review of my account and when the restriction might be lifted. I was informed by Laurel Road customer service that the review time by their fraud department is indefinite and that they'll finish their review when it is finished and that no amount of complaint that I voiced will speed up the process, etc. I also expressed frustration to the customer service agents I've spoken with about how this is aggravating and frustrating for them to restrict/hold my account as I need my money to help pay my bills and without knowing a time when the restriction will be lifted, it puts a stress on me financially. 

It is Monday, 2023 XX/XX/XXXX as I'm typing this complaint with the CFPB - almost two ( 2 ) weeks since they placed the hold/restriction on my Laurel Road Loyalty Checking account and I'm unable to get any direction/clarification as to when I'll be able to access my own money again. I'm beyond frustrated because a good portion of my first paycheck was deposited into that Laurel Road Loyalty Checking account and now I don't have access to my own hard earned money that I need to help pay some bills that are coming up. Customer service has expressed that it usually takes no more than 30 days for the fraud department to finish their review but I think they fail to realize that these are real people whom they are affecting by restricting accounts. 

I told the customer service rep since the fraud department is unable to be contacted, that they should've contacted me first if there was an issue with an external account instead of completely restricting my account without discussing the issue first. 

I have no one else to turn to but the CFPB and hopefully you can help.",,KEYCORP,FL,32211,,Consent provided,Web,2023-10-16,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,,7705919

Experian did not respond to me in writing and include the method of verification under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 7 ). 
I contacted the courthouse to verify their information release policy. The court informed me that they do not provide anyone with a debtors full social security number and they do not provide ANY credit bureau ANY information about ANY bankruptcy cases. 
Secondly, As I previously stated in my 1st dispute, the information is inaccurate on my consumer report. It is listed on my consumer report as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Which is incorrect. The Correct name is United States Bankruptcy Court. The state and zip code are also not listed in report. 

It is quite clear that someone from Experian lied about verifying this bankruptcy with the courthouse. That is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 
As you know, it is also a violation of the FCRA to report inaccurate or unverifiable information on a credit report. Thus, I demand that you IMMEDIATELY REMOVE the following bankruptcy from my credit report : XXXX XXXX XXXX  Docket # XXXX Please respond to me in writing and include the method of verification under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 7 ).

2024-06-20,Checking or savings account,Savings account,Closing an account,Can't close your account,"This is my second complaint against Citibank. The initial complaint was simply trying to "" unlock '' my account. This complaint is in regards to a separate issue involving trying to close the same account. 

I am trying to close my Citibank Accelerated Savings Account. I opened the account on or about XX/XX/XXXX. Subsequent to XX/XX/XXXX I have not made any deposits or withdrawals from the account. In the course of time I received numerous notifications from Citibank that my account had been locked due to "" inactivity. '' As this is a traditional savings account I did not respond or engage in any "" activity. '' Recently I tried to close my Citibank Accelerated Savings account. I was informed that my account had been locked due to "" inactivity '' and that I was not allowed to close, withdraw or transfer any of my money w/o going through a lengthy onerous process of re-activating/unlocking my account : drive to nearest branch ( I live in CO - nearest Branch is in XXXX XXXX XXXX or send them a notarized letter ( closest Notary is 30 miles & charges a Notary fee ) via snail mail and wait. 

Locking my savings account due to inactivity WAS NOT disclosed under the Terms of opening a savings account - I specifically inquired about this prior to opening the account. I have a copy of the original Terms of the account upon opening. There is no language referring to "" locking '' an account due to inactivity. 

In addition, the Citibank Website states : If you ask for my personal and financial information and I don't provide it will you place restrictions on my account? 
If we don't receive the requested information, we may restrict your accounts.

For checking, savings and money market accounts, you won't be able to make deposits, withdrawals or transfers. Those transactions will be denied or returned. YOU MAY STILL CLOSE YOUR ACCOUNT. ( emphasis added ) In short by your own statement I should be able to close my account w/o providing the personal & financial information requested to "" unlock my account. '' Unlocking my account and closing my account are two ( 2 ) separate issues! Without disclosing that you would close my account due to inactivity YOU closed my account and now YOU impose the requirement of providing personal & financial information to unlock my account in order to close my account- which is ILLEGAL and in contradiction to what you state on your website! 

As much a Citibank may attempt to justify this behavior under the aegis of "" know your client '' and trying to ensure the security of my account by denying or encumbering access to my account w/o prior full disclosure IS ILLEGAL. Verifying identity is a simple and expedient process in today 's world. I have confirmed this with my Fiduciary as well as legal counsel. I have no problem with verifying my identity by providing either by telephone or on the Citibank website the answers to the security ( or any other ) questions essential to verify my identity.

2023-05-23,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Other personal consumer report,Incorrect information on your report,Information is incorrect,"TransUnion violation of my consumer rights has had a detrimental impact on my life. They reported inaccurate information on my credit report, which was only rectified after significant damage had already been done. As a result, I encountered 3 different items on my report that caused me to miss out on life-changing opportunities. TransUnion actions are directly responsible for the denial of loans and credit cards, ultimately resulting in the complete ruin of my life. Therefore, I am pursuing legal action against TransUnion for defamation of character. 
As a consumer, I placed my trust in TransUnion to accurately report and maintain my credit information. However, I recently discovered that TransUnion has reported inaccurate and misleading information on my credit report. These erroneous entries remained on my report for an extended period, causing substantial harm and preventing me from accessing life-changing opportunities. 

Specifically, I found 3 different items on my credit report that were falsely reported by TransUnion. These inaccurate entries resulted in the denial of loans, credit cards, and other financial opportunities that would have had a significant positive impact on my life. The consequences of TransUnion negligence and failure to rectify the situation in a timely manner have been devastating, both financially and emotionally. 

In light of the aforementioned damages caused by TransUnion, I have consulted with legal counsel, and I hereby provide you with this formal Letter of Intent to Sue. It is my intention to pursue legal action against TransUnion for the following claims : Defamation of Character : TransUnion inaccurate reporting has unjustly damaged my reputation and character, resulting in tangible harm to my personal and professional life. Given the seriousness of the matter, I believe it is in both parties ' best interest to resolve this issue amicably and without protracted litigation. Therefore, I present the following settlement demand as a starting point for negotiations : Financial Compensation : I demand fair and just financial compensation in the amount of [ specify the amount you deem appropriate ] to address the damages I have incurred as a direct result of TransUnion actions. 

Corrective Measures : TransUnion must take immediate steps to rectify the inaccurate information on my credit report and ensure that such errors do not recur in the future. This includes updating my credit report with accurate information and providing written confirmation of the correction. 

Prevention of Future Harm : TransUnion must implement robust procedures and safeguards to prevent similar incidents from happening to other consumers. This includes reviewing internal processes, enhancing data accuracy protocols, and providing regular training to employees responsible for handling consumer credit information. 

I firmly believe that reaching a fair settlement will not only save both parties valuable time and resources but also help restore my trust in TransUnion commitment to consumer rights and data integrity. Please consider this letter as an opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions and negotiate a settlement that addresses the harm I have suffered. I request a response within [ specify a reasonable time frame, typically 30 days ] from the date of this letter to initiate the settlement discussions. Failure to respond or engage in good-faith negotiations will leave me with no choice but to proceed with legal action to protect my rights and seek appropriate remedies. I strongly advise you to forward this letter to your legal department and inform your designated representative to contact me at the earliest convenience. You may reach me at the provided contact information above.

Complaint against : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX / XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Background : On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent an email to XXXX XXXX, the apartment XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX to inquire about options for my daughter XXXX XXXX XXXX to break her lease. XXXX informed me that the fee to terminate the lease was 2 months of rent ( {$2700.00} ) along with a 45-day notice. 
On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX sent an email to XXXX XXXX apartment informing them that she was providing them with a 45-day notice with plans to move out on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX contacted her on XX/XX/XXXX confirming he had received the email and that he would honor the terms provided in the email by XXXX XXXX. Additionally, he communicated to XXXX there would be no additional charges. 
XXXX paid XXXX rent. She then sent a check to XXXX XXXX Apartments for {$2700.00}. The check was delivered on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX confirmed that XXXX received the check. 

Reason for the complaint : 1 ) Harassing phone calls, 2 ) pressured into providing account information, 3 ) withdrawing funds from XXXX account with providing details for the charges. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX received a Collections call from XXXX XXXX from IQ Data International , INC. During the phone call XXXX XXXX XXXX that she owed XXXX an additional {$970.00}. She told XXXX that if she did not pay the {$970.00} by XX/XX/XXXX, IQ Data International , Inc. would report her to the credit agency on XX/XX/XXXX ( 7 days later ). During the call XXXX pressured XXXX into providing her Credit Card information so she would not have negative credit. On XX/XX/XXXX, IQ International withdrew XXXX from her checking account, overdrawing her account. 
XXXX felt forced to provide her account information as she was looking to rent housing in XXXX XXXX and did not want the negative credit reporting to impact her ability to find housing. 
After hearing about the call, I reached out to IQ Data International Inc. 
a ) We had no prior knowledge of any additional funds owed prior to receiving the collections call. We did not receive written notice of any additional funds owed. 
b ) I asked XXXX what she was going to report the credit agency given we werent delinquent. She did not provide a response or any details as to what she would be reporting to the credit agency. 
c ) When I asked what we owed {$970.00} for, XXXX could not provide any information. She did, however, give me hypothetical examples of what the charges could be She told me it could be for cleaning the apartment. She asked me if we had a walk through and if we didnt, it was probably for damages. ( note, XXXX stopped by the office on multiple occasions on the day we moved out and no one was in the office for a walk-through ) d ) When XXXX called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX inquire about the additional charges, they told her she did not owe any money and they currently processing her deposit refund. We provided a {$400.00} deposit when we signed the lease agreement.

I checked my Avant acct online to confirm automatic payments were not enabled and that there were no scheduled payments. I confirmed this. Today another "" unauthorized payment '' was made on my Avant credit account. I called Avant customer service and was met with what I expected - denial of unauthorized payments by the XXXX. I was told that all of the months with double payments were made online via the website. I was told that I must have made the payments and forgot! I absolutely did not make two payments per month. I did not give authorisation for the second payments to be made. I can not understand why Avant would do this but have read multiple instances of the exact same complaint via XXXX search. At this point I am at a loss as to what I should do or even accept as a solution.

I have addressed Equifax and have pointed out all the violations they have made against me and the laws they are breaking. I have exhausted all means of communication with Equifax, therefore I am now contacting you CFPB, to help put a stop to these abusive practices and help me obtain the remedy I am entitled to. 
- 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 3 ) = Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers. Equifax is not a government agency and I have not given direct permission to Equifax to report on me or for me.

- 15 USC 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ) = Consumer reporting agencies need to exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. Equifax has not respected my right to privacy. 
- 15 USC 1681a ( d ) ( 2 ) ( A ) ( i ) = Consumer reports do not include information solely as to transactions between the consumer and the person making the report. The report from Equifax displays transactions of alleged debts.

- 15 USC 1681a ( d ) ( 2 ) ( B ) = a consumer report does not include any authorization or approval of a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly by the issuer of a credit card. I am in fact the only one who can issue credit through a credit card, which in this case is issued through my Social Security card, therefore Equifax must stop violating my rights and privacy.

- 15 USC 1681a ( e ) = A consumer report is obtained through personal interviews with friends or neighbors of the consumer and such report shall not include specific factual information on a consumers credit record obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer or from a consumer reporting agency when such information was obtained directly from a creditor of the consumer. All accounts that Equifax has or had included in my consumer report have been obtained from third parties not authorized or permitted by law. 
- 15 USC 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) = A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report in accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. I have only given directions to Equifax in my recent correspondences, to furnish such report including only information that follows my written instructions, but Equifax has continued to report incorrect data.

- Pursuant to the FCRA and Public Law No. 91-508 ( 15 USC 1681g ), Equifax has not disclosed to me any documents that they have recorded and retained in their file at the time of the requests concerning the accounts that Equifax has or had reported in my credit report, therefore, all accounts must be deleted immediately.

Equifax has willfully failed to comply with any requirement imposed under Title 15 Chapter 41 Subchapter III and FCRA, therefore I am entitled to {$1000.00} per violation, not including actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the damages.

This inconsistency may be a violation of FCRA Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), which requires credit reporting agencies to provide accurate and complete information about consumer accounts. 

FCRA Section 605 ( a ) ( 4 ) - Reporting Accurate Account Status : XXXX reports the account as "" Late 30 Days, '' while TransUnion and XXXX indicate "" Current '' and "" Paid, '' respectively.

FCRA Section 605 ( a ) ( 6 ) - Reporting Accurate Credit Limit : XXXX erroneously reports the "" Account Type - Detail '' as "" Unsecured loan, '' which affects the "" Credit Limit '' field, showing "" {$0.00}. '' This is inaccurate as the account is an "" Auto Loan '' and does not have a credit limit. This may be a violation of FCRA Section 605 ( a ) ( 6 ), which mandates accurate reporting of credit limit information. 

I request that you conduct a thorough investigation into these discrepancies and promptly take corrective action to remove the inaccuracies from my credit reports. As per the FCRA, please provide me with written confirmation of the corrections made. 

I am attaching copies of relevant supporting documents that validate my claims. I trust that TransUnion, XXXX, and XXXX will fulfill their obligations under the FCRA to ensure accurate and fair reporting of consumer credit information.

Following this call, I contacted XXXX and explained the situation and asked that, if she were to get the promised refund, could she please just send me a check. A week or so went by and I heard nothing, so I checked my PayPal summary page again to see if the refund took place. It had not- {$50.00} still "" waiting ''. 

I called PayPal again, reiterating my prior complaint and voicing my displeasure with the preceding experience, and the agent who helped me assured me that the situation was resolved and that my next purchase would "" tap '' the {$50.00}. So, on XX/XX/2021, I made another XXXX purchase in the amount of {$22.00}, expecting to see the {$50.00} decremented. Again, this did not happen. 

So, again, I called PayPal and yet another agent told me that, in order to have access to my money, I needed to set up the "" cash account '' or "" link a bank account ''. There was, he said, no way to send a check ( even though the website had a "" send a paper check instead '' button ) or put the money against my existing credit cards. I told him that I did not want to give out my bank account number and/or my complete identity ( full legal name, address, social security number, last four of the social security number, and date of birth ) just to access money someone else had sent me. I indicated that my money was basically a XXXX to PayPal 's XXXX  for personal information and that I didn't like that and would communicate this to the regulatory authorities ( that being you ). 

Just around the first of XXXX, XXXX, I was contemplating writing to you about this issue, but I decided to give PayPal another call because each time I had called previously, there was a new twist from the agent on the phone. So I called again, and this fourth time, the agent seemed much more sympathetic to my complaint, indicating that he had heard this many times before. After considerable back and forth, he said that the option to choose how to pay was displayed when I entered the "" Pay with PayPal '' screen at the time of purchase- that this would be visible as "" Source of Funds ''. He implored my to try that on the next purchase and said that, if access to the {$50.00} was not successful after that, I should call again and they would "" cut me a check ''. So yesterday, I went on XXXX and attempted to purchase some literature for {$18.00} plus shipping. When I went to pay with PayPal, I attempted to located the "" Source of Funds '' choice to which this agent had eluded. It wasn't there. I cancelled the purchase and called PayPal again today with this whole story, asking this time to speak with a supervisor. I was told that the {$50.00} I had available could only be had if I provided the personal information they wanted, otherwise they would just keep it. 

After this, I went back on XXXX and bought my literature and paid directly with my credit card, thus bypassing PayPal altogether. Following the purchase, I attempted to locate a number for the PayPal Corporate offices to voice my complaint higher up the food chain, but the number supplied online eventually took me back to the same "" customer service '' place I had been to so many times before, where the agent again said the the {$50.00} would be held pending the disclosure of the information they wanted. I again repeated that I wanted the money applied to future purchases, put back on the credit card ( s ) I had already on file, or sent via check. She refused. 

It was at this point that I contacted your office to request assistance and was told to submit this complaint. Your representative mentioned that there were "" thousands '' of complaints against PayPal but that she didn't know if any were exactly my issue. 

What I want is my {$50.00}. They can apply it to future purchases ( the preferred method ), credit it to the credit card I have on file, or send me a check for the money. 

What I want for everybody is for this practice to be disclosed up front. Had I known that the money that I was offered via PayPal would be held XXXX for personal information, I would not have agreed to accept payment via PayPal. I suspect that had the sender known this, she might have offered to pay a different way. PayPal needs to get agreement from all parties BEFORE the money changes hands. I think that if all parties are aware of this crazy policy, fewer will be likely to offer payment via or accept payment from PayPal. 

One final note : I am willing to supply to you any necessary information, including my login information so that you can see the trail for yourself. Please simply let me know if I can assist in any way. Please note that PayPal states that all calls are recorded and that "" notes '' are kept by their representatives when customer service calls are received, so PayPal will be the repository of all related documentation and conversation regarding this matter.

I have followed the guidelines provided by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission and the State of Georgia Attorney General 's office of Consumer Affairs in their guidelines to attempt to recoup the {$400.00} paid to the merchant which includes : 1. a failed attempted negotiation with the merchant for recoup of funds or delivery of the goods ; 2. disputing the {$400.00} transaction with my bank , Bank of America . However, as of the date of this complaint I have ye
t to receive a satisfactory result which would be Bank of America supporting my dispute and restoring the {$400.00} funds to my account. I am disappointed and dismayed at the lack of action on the part of Bank of America in support of me as their consumer, especially in light of the deceptive consumer practices recently attributed to Bank of America. I would think that BoA would want to restore the trust of consumers rather than further eroding that trust. I am respectfully requesting that the {$400.00} be restored to me, forthwith. I have provided and proven to Bank of America that the merchant failed to satisfy the terms for this transaction. In addition, BoA has placed the burden of proof on me as their customer, when instead it should have been the merchant providing proof of the satisfaction and delivery of these goods and services that I paid for, which the merchant can not, and will not, be able to show.

The letter also states "" You have the right to request copies of the documents that we relied on in making our determination ''. I called to request this information and was told I could file an appeal and ask for the documents. I did both via email and a written letter. I called to make sure they had received my appeal and was told they had and I would hear from them in 45-90 days. That time had passed and I heard nothing. I called and was told my appeal was denied and I would get a letter explaining their decision and documentation in 7-10 business days. That was on XX/XX/XXXX and I didn't get anything. I called this morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and was told I didn't get anything because there was no documentation to send me. It was my understanding that they are required to show documentation that they did in fact carry out an investigation of my claims and that the disputed transactions were indeed authorized ( which they were not ). During this process I got a letter stating that I needed to get in touch with the fraud department because they needed more information and when I called the number on the letter I would only get the general customer service department who couldn't tell me what more information I need to provide and just told me to further explain my claim which I did via email.

2021-09-23,Debt collection,Medical debt,Written notification about debt,Didn't receive notice of right to dispute,"I am attempting to apply for a mortgage and it was identified that I had a mark on my credit report for {$120.00} from MediCredit , Inc . It shows the case was opened on XX/XX/XXXX, reported on XX/XX/XXXX, but also a XXXX balance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called MediCredit, Inc at XXXX and explained I wanted to find out what the issue was. They stated they needed an account number, my phone number, and/or my name. I did not have an account number so I provided my name and phone number -- neither showed that I had an account. The rep told me they could not help me since I did not show I ever had an account. I explained MediCredit put a mark on my credit report so I needed to speak to someone about removing it. The representative told me MediCredit did not remove marks on credit reports -- and that I could not be forwarded on to a supervisor or anyone else since I am not showing I ever had an account. I explained multiple times that I needed some way to speak to someone who could help since it sounded like it was an incorrect mark on my credit report. The representative would not provide me a name or help me any further.

I called back four other times, hoping to get through to a representative who could help me. Please note that on my second or third call, the representative asked me for my SSN. The first rep had mentioned to me that no one should ever ask for my SSN to verify my account so I did not provide that to her. Only one out of five representatives asked for my SSN -- I believe her name was XXXX. I know I spoke to a XXXX  at one point. 

On the fourth call, the representative, "" XXXX, '' said she found my account. She was able to do that by asking me additional details about myself that no other rep did. It turns out, my information was not correct in their system. She would not tell me everything that was incorrect but one item was definitely my name. She asked me a bunch of information about my current address, number, name -- and updated the system. She also provided me with an Account Number.

After she found my account, I explained my situation and asked to talk to someone about having the mark on my credit removed. She explained that MediCredit never removes marks. I explained that I have called multiple times and no one has been able to find my account. And if no one could find my account then whatever had been sent to me either never made it, did not have my name or information correct, and/or looked like spam. 

She told me the only thing that she could do for me was to provide me a letter showing that my account had a XXXX balance. She told me she also saw on XX/XX/XXXX ( unsure year ), my account showed that it was, "" recalled. '' She believe that meant the delinquency should have been removed. I asked for a letter explaining on XX/XX/XXXX that the delinquency was removed -- and asked if she could include that in my XXXX balance letter. She told me she could not do that. That she could only send me a XXXX balance letter. I asked to talk to her supervisor and she told me they would tell me the same thing she is. She advised me to try and contact the credit agencies to have the delinquency removed and recommended using the "" XXXX XXXX '' app and repeated that they could not help. 

After pleading with her to talk to her supervisor, she continued to explain that none of her three supervisors were available and that they would be telling me the same thing she is. After about 10 minutes of me saying I would wait until one was available she transferred me to a, "" Mr. XXXX XXXX. '' The phone rang to voicemail so I left a message explaining my issue and have not heard back. 

My request is to have the negative mark/delinquency on my credit report removed from all three credit agencies. After my multiple attempts to work with MediCredit yesterday it is clear to me that they did not have my correct information and the error is on their side. They did not have my first and last name or phone number anywhere in their system. I am very good at paying my debts and would not purposefully avoid paying one -- especially one at {$120.00}. This one {$120.00} mark on my credit is hurting my score by ~80 points and affecting my loan so I am asking that this be resolved as soon as possible. My "" fear '' now is if they have to provide you with their records that they will only show my correct information that was updated yesterday -- and not show how their system actually had me during their debt collection period. 

An additional request is to look into MediCredit 's processes and practices. The fact that I could not get to a supervisor without an account was very frustrating. And the fact that the supervisor still has not reached back out to me is beyond annoying. There may be other individuals who have been mistreated by this company as well.

As a consumer, I am deeply concerned about the impact of this inaccurate reporting on my financial well-being and reputation. 

On XX/XX/2024, I obtained a copy of my consumer report from the CRA and discovered that there were several inaccuracies in the information reported. Specifically, the date this account was opened, and date last active, all three bureaus are showing different dates. 

These inaccuracies have had a detrimental effect on my credit score and have made it difficult for me to access credit or financial services.

This has caused me undue stress and financial hardship, as I have been unfairly penalized for information that is not a true reflection of my credit history.

I believe that NATLCRSYS 's actions are in direct violation of my rights under 15 USC 1681-s 2 ( 7 ) ( A ), which requires consumer reporting agencies to maintain accurate and up-to-date information on consumer reports. By failing to do so, NATLCRSYS has not only harmed my financial standing but has also undermined my trust in the consumer reporting system.

Additionally, under 12 CFR 1006.34 ( c ) ( 4 ) ( i ), debt collectors are required to provide consumers with written notification of their rights. I have not received any such notification from NATLCRSYS, which is a clear violation of this regulation.

I am seeking your assistance in investigating this matter and ensuring that NATLCRSYS complies with the relevant laws and regulations governing consumer reporting.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt resolution. 

Thank you for your time and assistance.

When I bought it and checked out He sent a refund and said I dont like XXXX, lets use the XXXX app instead so I went over to the XXXX  app and tried sending the XXXX dollars to him and I kept getting declined so I told him I couldnt use the XXXX app because theres problems with my card. I called my bank Wells Fargo and asked them if they could unblock my card which is what they did. After that, He recommended XXXX which was a way to send money through the Wells Fargo app. He said he would send out the hoodie when I paid. I paid him the XXXX dollars and then he gave a shipping number and said yep Ill ship your package immediately. So I was happy and all then a few hours later I contacted him asking what the tracking number because I wanted to make sure it was the right one because it wasnt moving anywhere. He read my text and didnt reply anything. Ive been trying to contact him for 3 days now and Ive gotten no response. When I check my shipment through the usps app it says label created, not yet in system. Its been like that for 3 days also. I am strongly confident that he scammed me for the money and just left.

2. Conduct a thorough investigation into why my initial requests were not fulfilled.

3. Take the necessary steps to ensure that such issues do not recur in the future.

This company has ruined my credit score so bad I got denied a loan for my house!! Now I can not provide for my family because of these derogatory marks. These medical bills and other derogatory collection accounts listed on my credit report, are incorrect and NOT mine. Simply verifying that someone used my name, social security number and/or address is insufficient to confirm that I am the person in question and owe this debt. 
The court has ruled that in Hinkle v. Midland Credit Management , Inc.,  that during a dispute and subsequent investigation with the original creditor, collector or a credit bureau, that the original creditor or collector, must provide account-level documentation that would hold up when presented to a jury. That means an original contract or similar proof. To this end, I am demanding an itemized bill to include but not limited to : The diagnosis and procedure performed that I am being billed for, Dates of said procedure, Cost of any medication you may have provided, Cost of any medical devices you may have provided, Office Visits, Consultations, Hospital Visits, Misc. 
As I am not the person who owes this bill, I am aware that providing the information requested may lead to third party disclosure : a HIPAA violation. That would be your problem and not mines, as a consumer. And per the FCRA and FCPA, I am not required to complete a police report since the burden to prove the debt is on you. 
In addition, a provision of the FACTA regulations is the Notice of Negative Information provision, covered in section 623 ( A ) ( 7 ). 
I have never received notification that this had been or was going to be listed with a credit reporting agency. FACTA ( Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ) requires creditors, including doctors and hospitals, to give the consumer a warning notice, so the matter can be addressed before a negative item such as this is reported in error. 
I am also requesting a copy of your in-house procedures that enable you to avoid the problems that lead to improper identification of consumers and the subsequent misreporting to the credit bureaus. 
In lieu of supplying the information Im demanding, you can simply stop all collection activity, including but not limited to removing this item from all credit bureaus to which it has been reported. If this is not done within 30 days of receipt of this letter, I will proceed to exercise all my legal rights, including litigation, to protect my good name. 

A response with a bill is NOT evidence of proof that the debt is mine. Anyone can open an account under my name for which a bill is produced, but that doesn't mean it was actually me or that the debt is actually mine. I need real evidence. This evidence consists of a contract from the original creditor or some agreement bearing MY written signature agreeing to pay the debt. In the absence of this evidence I ask you to please remove this account from my credit report.

2021-01-26,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I am writing to request that you conduct a review of Citis consumer dispute policies and procedures. I do not feel that a complete investigation was conducted regarding my billing dispute XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a billing dispute online via Citis website regarding the transaction posted XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter requesting that I provide specific details and documentation regarding the billing dispute. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I provided Citi a detailed statement and documents via e-mail regarding the reasons I am disputing the amount. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an e-mail from Citi stating they contacted the merchant and gave the merchant until XX/XX/XXXX, to respond. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from Citi with the response they had received from the merchant. The letter requested a signed letter detailing my response to the merchants claims. Additionally, Citi requested dates I had contacted the merchant and their response to my request for a refund. Citi requested a response by XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I provided a response to Citi via e-mail that stated my response was in addition to the previous response I submitted dated XX/XX/XXXX. My initial letter detailed the attempts to obtain a refund from the merchant, who stated on XX/XX/XXXX, As things return to normal and our cash flow returns to normal we will issue a refund. To date, we have not received a refund from the merchant. Additionally, my follow-up letter informed Citi that I had never received nor signed the document the merchant provided, and again advised that the merchant did not supply any goods or services. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Citi dated XX/XX/XXXX, informing me that Citi had reversed the conditional credit and they were unable to assist. Since this letter did not provide a written explanation as to the reasons why Citi found in favor of the merchant I contacted Citi via phone and was advised that my follow-up response submitted on XX/XX/XXXX, needed to include information that was provided in my initial letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed that a good faith credit would be requested. My wife also contacted Citi and was informed that our response was not submitted timely and we were past Visas charge back date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife contacted Citi and was informed that the dispute had been reopened and to disregard the closed notification letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from Citi dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating the XXXX is unable to assist with the dispute as they have no recourse available to recover the funds. Again, since the letter did not provide a written explanation as to the reasons why Citi is unable to recover the funds I contacted the Company via phone and was informed that Visa reviews disputes and made the determination.

Pursuant to 12 CFR 1026.13 ( b ) ( 2 ) Citi did not properly complete an investigation within two complete billing cycles, nor did they provide the reasons they found in favor of the merchant. I did NOT receive any goods or services from merchant. Additionally, the merchants response to Citi did not include compelling evidence of a signed contract, nor did it include documentation that I had been provided a copy of the documentation that they sent to Citi. 

It appears Citi did not properly review my responses that were submitted in a timely manner. Additionally, it appears that since Citi did not properly complete its investigation within 90 days, Visa is advising it is past the charge back date.

Additionally, when a consumer advises Citi that the contract the merchant provided to Citi was never seen, nor signed by the consumer, and goods or services were NOT provided, it should be expected that Citis policies and procedures would include reaching back out to the merchant to obtain proof of a signed contract, or proof that the contract the merchant provided was provided to the consumer at the time of the transaction. However, that was never done by Citi. 

Additionally, I am not sure what policies and procedures Citi has when submitting the dispute to Visa to review but since I did NOT receive any good or services from the merchant, it is my understanding that this should have been disputed under Visa Condition XXXX Cancelled Merchandise/Services rather than Visa Condition XXXX Not as Described or Defective Merchandise/Services. I believe it was processed under the XXXX Condition based on the letter from Citi dated XX/XX/XXXX which provided the Dispute Reason Code as 1330. Again, I feel this was the improper condition as NO goods or services were ever received and I requested a full refund prior to the scheduled date services were to be provided. 

In summary, had Citi followed proper policies and procedures and conducted a complete and thorough investigation into this matter Citi would have found this billing dispute as valid and provided a refund to me as the consumer. A complete and through investigation into this matter should have included reaching out to the merchant and obtaining a response prior to 90 days after the dispute was initiated, a complete review of all responses submitted from the customer, and advising the merchant that in order to conduct a proper investigation into this matter Citi requires documentation of a signed contract and proof that their non-refundable deposit policy was properly disclosed to the consumer prior to the deposit transaction.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"CITIBANK, N.A.",OH,45255,,Consent provided,Web,2021-01-26,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,,4093448

2023-04-25,Vehicle loan or lease,Loan,Getting a loan or lease,Changes in terms mid-deal or after closing,"On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Illinois and was approved for a loan through Bridgecrest financial institution of about XXXX and I made a down payment of {$2000.00}. I submitted to them my work check stubs, insurance and all other documents they asked for and was approved on the spot for the vehicle. 

On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I received an email from Bridgecrest stating that they needed additional documents for the post sales verification process to continue to honor the loan and these documents requested were my Bank Statements for the month of XXXX and my check stubs from XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I received a phone call from XXXX ( the person who sold me the vehicle at XXXX XXXX  ) stating they needed the Bank Statements by XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  to confirm my direct deposits matched my check stubs because there was a discrepancy with my check stubs and if they were not received by this date then the bank would request that I return the vehicle back to the dealership. He later sent me a link via text message to submit the bank statements through XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX 

On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I attempted to upload the documents to XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX  but XXXX sent me a link to submit the XXXX statements instead of the XXXX statements so the system would not allow me to upload them into the system. I called XXXX to inform him of this mishap and per his request, I emailed the XXXX XXXX  Bank Statements to his work email address ( XXXX ) with my direct deposits that matched my check stubs on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I received a text message from XXXX stating that he had not received my bank statements and he asked if I could send them to him again so that he could get them uploaded into the system for Bridgecrest. I then sent another email to XXXX with the requested documents and I sent him a text message to confirm that he had received them this time via email. He confirmed that he had received and submitted the bank statements to Bridgecrest and that he would let me know when he received an update. 

On Monday XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I reached out to XXXX before going to work letting him know that he could leave me a voice message or a text message when he received an update from the bank and that I would give him a call back when I get off work. He texted me back that he hadn't heard anything back rom the bank and that he would let me know as soon as he did and that was the last time I heard from him. 

A week later on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I visited XXXX XXXX  to receive to tire air pressure caps for my two back wheels because I hadn't noticed that they were not there upon purchase of the vehicle. No one in the dealership told me that I needed to return the car or that the bank denied my documents. I never received any type of notification XXXX XXXX XXXX or Bridgecrest stating that my documents were not approved for post-verification so I continued to pay on my car note in advance. 

I made payments on my car note on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ( {$97.00} ), XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ( {$65.00} ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( {$130.00} ) ( the due date ). Upon making these payments I still never received notice from the bank XXXX XXXX XXXX that my documents were not approved and that they needed me to return the vehicle so I thought that everything was in the clear. 

On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  at XXXX XXXX  I called the local police department because my car was not outside and I thought it had been stolen. They informed me that my car was reposed the previous night around XXXX XXXX. 

I immediately called XXXX XXXX to ask them what was the reason for the repossession and they could not give me an answer and suggested I call Bridgecrest since they were the lenders. I called Bridgecrest to inquire about the repossession and the only thing they could tell me was that I did not meet the post verification process due to the discrepancy in my pay ( the initial reason they requested my bank statements ) and when I asked them about receiving my bank statements they told me I had to reach back out to XXXX XXXX. Additionally, the agent told me that it would take about 4-6 weeks for them to reverse the charges and issue me a refund because XXXX XXXX has to inspect the vehicle and confirm that it is in the same condition in which I received it. 

I called XXXX XXXX once again and asked them if my bank statements were submitted and the manager told me they were submitted and the only thing he can see in the system was that the documents were waiting to be reviewed but it did not say whether they were approved or denied. He also repeated to me that they did the post verification process and had a discrepancy in my pay which is why they needed the bank statements in the first place but that the submission of the bank statements typically clears up that discrepancy with the bank. 

I then asked the manager if he could reach out to Bridgecrest in order to find out if they approved or denied my documents on their end since they XXXX XXXX XXXX ) did not have a definite answer and he told me that it was unlikely that he would receive an answer from the bank, especially as a third party. The manager told me he would reach back out to me with any updates whether he received an answer or not from Bridgecrest. 

This phone call prompted me to call Bridgecrest once more to confirm if my bank statements had been approved and looked at by them and they did not have a clear answer for me. They told me that XXXX XXXX handles the contracts and they would have any answers regarding whether or not my documents were looked at and I told them XXXX XXXX did not have any answers for me and told me to call them ( the bank ). During both calls to Bridgecrest I asked to speak to a manager that may be able to give me more answers but they were only able to redirect me to customer relations and said they would not be able to answer the questions I had and only XXXX XXXX could do that. 

Both of these companies have not been able to give me a clear cut explanation as to why my car has been repossessed and they are giving me the run arounds between both of them when I try to get answers. This entire ordeal has been very stressful and tiresome and I would like to request a FULL refund of my {$2000.00} and the {$290.00} I paid towards my car note if Bridgecrest is not going to honor the original loan agreement and they knew full and well that they ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) had plans to repossess my car. 

I would also like a full explanation in WRITING as to why my car was repossessed and why I did not receive a phone call, voicemail or email stating to return the vehicle before it was repossessed with my personal belongings. Additionally, I would like to be reimbursed for the cost of going to collect my belongings from XXXX XXXX XXXX the repossession company ) because I was not given the choice to return the vehicle to the dealership on my own accord, which I would have done with no problem had I received notice of the loan being reversed.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Bridgecrest Acceptance Corporation,IL,604XX,,Consent provided,Web,2023-04-25,Closed with explanation,Yes,,6887488
2022-06-24,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Problem with a lender or other company charging your account,Money was taken from your account on the wrong day or for the wrong amount,"Re : Claim Number XXXX I am writing regarding a fraud/scam about two transactions worth of {$500.00} and {$300.00} through XXXX which occurred on XXXX. The narrative below explains the series of events and why I feel the harm could have been prevented or resolved in time. 

I posted an add on XXXX XXXX and I started getting electronic texts from the buyer through XXXX XXXX app about the item I was trying to sell. The buyer showed interest in buying the item and asked me for my address, XXXX number and email id. She claimed she made a payment of {$340.00} through XXXX. I also got an email from XXXX stating the same. I was informed to contact the buyer to make another {$500.00} payment to me so that XXXX can release the original payment. She agreed to send me {$500.00} and asked me to refund that {$500.00} back to her. I resisted and asked I could not understand why I was getting asked to refund the money. I also informed her I can not share the screenshots from my chase bank mobile app. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX customer support ( at XXXX PM, before the transaction occurred ) for inquiring about the legitimacy of this request ( proof attached here ). 
Shortly after, I got another email stating the total amount of {$890.00} ( XXXX original payment+XXXXXXXX business account bonus+XXXX security fee ) and followed by another email stating {$1100.00} would be released in 30 minutes once I refund the {$500.00} back and pay for the certificate fee of {$300.00}. I replied to the email asking what {$300.00} was for and If I would get the refund. The buyer tried calling me multiple times ( chat history attached here ) and a few minutes later, I received a notification from the chase bank mobile app ( at XXXX PM ) stating the {$300.00} was transferred to a person named XXXX ( screenshot attached here ). I immediately checked my chase bank mobile app and there was another fund transfer of {$500.00} already under pending status. Although, I opened the chase bank mobile app multiple times during that day and I also opened XXXX Pay option on that app but I do not recollect any memory of myself completing the transaction. I called chase bank customer support immediately ( call log history attached here ) and asked to cancel the pending transactions. I was informed that the transaction could not be cancelled even when called within minutes. However, I was reassured that the claims department would be able to take care of it. I also filed a claim for these two transactions. I blocked my chase bank online access immediately after the incident. I then kept getting emails and calls from the fraudulent person multiple times later in the day but I did not entertain. I also filed a police report for harassment through electronic communication ( report attached here ). 

How the harm could have been prevented/resolved? 

I called chase bank customer support immediately within minutes of these transactions and I was informed they could not reverse it but I was reassured that the claims department would be able to take care of it. When I contacted customer claims department of Chase bank, I was asked if I initiated the transaction. I informed that I opened the XXXX through Chase bank mobile app to see who the recipient was, I entered the details but I do not recollect how the transaction was complete. The claims department did not note my claim completely and the call was disconnected unfortunately. However, the claim was submitted incomplete. I called them again and the claim was completed for a fraud/almost scammed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a denial letter stating the claim was denied as per agreement. I called the claims department and explained there was no agreement that the letter was referring to. I was reassured that the investigation team was taking it as a Fraud and I would be getting my funds back within 10 business days ( by XX/XX/XXXX ). However, I receive another denial letter on XX/XX/XXXX from Chase bank stating the transaction was authorized by me. I appealed the decision and uploaded all the supporting documents to support my case. The documents were accepted on XX/XX/XXXX but the case was denied again. I spoke with the claims department on XX/XX/XXXX and I expressed my legal right to claim refunds of the payments not approved by me under electronic funds transfer act ( XXXX XXXX ). I also referred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau directive, stating the law applies "" if a third party fraudulently induces a consumer into sharing account access information. '' This is when someone tricks you into making a payment. So the whole idea that treachery is involved should mean consumers are protected by XXXX XXXX I was informed by claims department that since the investigation team could not prove those as unauthorized transactions, XXXX XXXX could not be applied since it was a scam. However, shortly after when I spoke with the claims escalation team, I was informed that the bank tried to contact the partner bank on XX/XX/XXXX to recover the funds based on XXXX  XXXX considering a scam, but the funds were withdrawn by the receiver and the partner bank denied the recovery of those funds. 

I also contacted the buyer again to send me the money in a good faith, however, the buyer confirmed she did not receive the money and claimed her money was stuck in the bank as well. In addition, I contacted XXXX and reported this fraudulent account, however I was informed that the Chase bank is one of the partner banks and should be the XXXX responsible for one-time courtesy credit in case they are unable to recover the funds ( in contrary to what I was told by Chase bank to contact the XXXX to give one-time courtesy refunds when I called them on XXXX ). 

I have attached proof of all the email and chat conversations with the XXXX and the buyer respectively, the call log history with Chase claims department and customer support. 

I performed all the steps to report these fraudulent transactions including a police report, contacting XXXX and chase bank in a time-sensitive manner. I still had to suffer the harm and I believe it could have been prevented or resolved. 

The following are the reasons I believe Chase bank should have done a better job in preventing or resolving the harm. 
1. Insufficient guidance- I was not guided sufficiently on next steps to deal with this fraud/scam. For an instance, I was asked to contact XXXX immediately after the incident while XXXX pay clearly suggested to contact Chase bank since the payment was initiated by XXXX feature in Chase mobile bank app. I was informed about the difference between fraud and scam on XX/XX/XXXX ( seven days later ) when I asked how it would change the way claim department would deal with it. The unnecessary delay of two weeks in applying XXXX XXXX and the consideration of fraud vs scam lead to a lack of recovery from the partner bank since it was too late ( as the money was withdrawn already from the account ) while the result could have been different had the chase bank approached the partner bank on the same day of the incident report. 
2. Misinformation- The denial letter indicated that the claim was denied as discussed while there was no discussion of why claim would be denied. 
3. False reassurance- I was reassured falsely that I will get the payment based on Fraud consideration instead of giving the clear direction of next steps. 

Please review my request and consider it for refund of the money I lost.

Finish now Calling Experian Customer Care at XXXX Reaching a customer service representative when calling Experian for any kind of credit report question is a difficult process. I recently called Experian to speak with someone seeking advice for improving my credit score but was never connected to a live agent. Instead, the call was disconnected after repetitive recordings sending me to Experian 's website for assistance. 

Upon calling, the automated system directs you to enter your Social Security number for identity verification, followed by a second authentication using either your ZIP Code or street number. I was guided to enter all three numbers before the automated system asked my reason for calling. The recording directs you to say in a few words exactly what you need. 

Without any specific menu options, I said the words 'raise credit score, ' but the system misheard me and thought I wanted information about freezing my credit file. This led to a recording telling me I could freeze my credit file to prevent creditors from accessing my information and could unfreeze my account by visiting Experian 's website. After providing me with the web link, the call hung up with no options to return to the main menu. 

I called again, going through the same verification process with my personal information. This time, I said the words 'credit score, ' which led the automated system to ask if I'd like instructions over the phone to receive my credit report or to be directed to the website. Neither of these choices was what I wanted, so I attempted to reach an agent by saying 'customer service. ' The automated recording recognized my request but, rather than transfer me to a customer service rep, stated that I could choose from options including credit freeze, order a credit report or file a fraud claim. Again, I said the words 'customer service ' since I needed none of these options, but the recording only acknowledged my request by saying that more information was needed. 

At this point, I was on the phone for at least 10 minutes attempting to reach someone or access a better choice. I said the words 'main menu, ' which returned me to the same automated message asking if I'd like instructions over the phone for accessing my credit score information or via the website. A third attempt at saying 'customer service ' led to a new automated recording indicating that the system could only transfer callers to specialists in limited circumstances, but I could press 1 for self-service. Apparently, my call wasn't considered one of those 'limited circumstances ' that could be transferred. 

After pressing 1 led me nowhere but to the repetitive messages, I hung up the phone and visited the website as the automated system directed to find a long list of frequently asked questions. As I learned, it's a very trying process to speak with an Experian rep via phone, as their system seems set up for automated requests only.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Experian Information Solutions Inc.,CA,XXXXX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2024-02-29,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8446571

2019-09-10,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"Based on

my records and knowledge: Circumstance: XX/XX/XXXX - I
submitted a re-investigation through the Major Credit Bureau, XXXX   COMENITYBANK/VICTORIA for the purposes of debt validation (to ensure accurate amount charged off, and to ensure that this is in fact my debt).

The high balance is showing: $XXXX & credit limit of: $XXXX

Issue: Considering the amount of time this debt has been on my report (over 6 years), I have no supporting documentation in my records to support the validity (proof) of the charged off amount of $XXXX And according to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, it's within my right as the consumer to ""ask the collector to verify the debt.""

Circumstance: Per XXXX   - Re-investigation Results: This item remained unchanged from our processing of your dispute in XX/XX/XXXX.

Issue: No clarification of documentation provided from the 3 major Credit Bureaus or Comenity Bank/Victoria.

Circumstance: As time went on, this item continued on my credit report. I submitted another re-investigation via XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to attempt once again to verify that correct amount of this debt.

XX/XX/XXXX Results of Re-Investigation from XX/XX/XXXX: Read ""This item was updated from our processing of your dispute in XX/XX/XXXX.""

Issue: I checked what ""update"" came from the dispute, and as I reviewed the ""Balance History"" via my XXXX Credit Report, I noticed that in the month of ""XX/XX/XXXX"" it has an amount of $XXXX   noted as a payment, on this charged off amount. Based on my recollection, I have made no payment to Comenity Bank/Victoria during that month!

Please explain how this information is accurate? What type of ""reporting"" game are you playing?

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Comenity Bank/Victoria's on XXXX: I explained to ""XXXX"" that I wanted to resolve a charged-off account showing on my credit report.

""XXXX"" was polite and helpful, and informed he would transfer me to the ""Payment Solutions Center"" I waited on hold, where 2 minutes later ""XXXX"" took my personal information and transferred me to another department where Mr. XXXX"" took my call.

Issue: Here is where the main issue comes in. Mr. XXXX started again, retrieving personal information to verify MY identity"" NOT the account. Mr. XXXX demeanor was short, rude abrasive and simply un-professional, when I asked him questions regarding the actual balance, interest and, simply the validity of the amount that is being reported!

I asked Mr. XXXX is there any way he could send me a copy of the charge-off account so I can verify the entire debt, and Mr. XXXX refused!! The conversation went into a verbal exchange between me and Mr. XXXX. Mr. XXXX   stated; you know this is your debt, as to bait me into compliance to pay a charged-off account that I called to resolve!

Simply put, if you are going to be in business for a company to negotiate with people and money, I would recommend you replace Mr. XXXX with someone who can actually achieve results, when consumers FINALLY call to settle matters that have to DEAL with THEIR MONEY! I DON'T CARE WHAT IS OWED OR HOW LONG IT HAS BEEN, A little more TACT on Mr. XXXX's part WOULD HAVE went A LONG WAY!

This charge off in the amount of $XXXX is scheduled to stay on my until ""XX/XX/XXXX"" as it appears to me Comenity/BANK is attempting to find little ways to ""continue"" this charge-off reporting on my credit much longer than 7 years!

To resolve this matter that is long overdue on my part! And in contrast, at this point would be of benefit to this LARGE BANK to resolve this matter in a professional/business manner to have one less ""charged-off"" account to deal with!",,"Bread Financial Holdings, Inc.",MD,20747,,Consent provided,Web,2019-09-10,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3368779

2022-07-17,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Domestic (US) money transfer,Fraud or scam,,"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Washington, DC XXXX XX/XX/XXXX This is to complain against the Wells Fargo. 
URGENCY : HIGH IMPORTANCE : HIGH [ WITHOUT PREJUDICE ] I wish to practice my right as a customer of Wells Fargo to use your organisation 's service, seeking a formal, impartial investigation to amicably settle my dispute ( Ref : XXXX ) with Wells Fargo. 
In order to clear up the myriad of letters and correspondences I have hitherto sent to Wells Fargo respecting my complaint, I believe it will substantially strengthen both my case and your understanding, by taking a deeper look at the happenings of my case, and analysing the relevant facts in an objective and comprehensive fashion. 
It is crucial to note that I have been manipulated, socially-engineered and coerced to engage these fraudulent criminals. Much to my embarrassment, I recognize that I am the victim of an investment scam. 
My complaint to the CFPB has arisen as I do not consider, by any stretch of the imagination, the conduct of Wells Fargo to be commensurate with their legal role and responsibility to their customers. They sell a service to look after their customers, protect their money and are a financial institution that maintains a traditional relationship and way of working with its customers. 
During the complaints process with Wells Fargo, I found their communication ineffective, which further hides their conduct to management and diminishes the service offering to their clients. 
They are struggling to adapt their business offering in the ever-changing world of IT development. The internet is presenting a real problem which they choose to manage in a way which is not in line with rules and regulations of CFPB as well as their own internal policy and procedures sold to their clients. 
General Obligation : Commencing on or around XX/XX/XXXX, I fell victim to two multi-layered scam operations run by XXXX XXXX XXXX which involved me making deposits for a total amount of XXXX USD from my Wells Fargo account to these fraudulent investment companies. 
When determining whats reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability ; common queries include, but are not limited to, the following : ( i ) whether Wells Fargo did not take notice of any rule, law, or regulation, and/or possibly missed any material elements of the relevant bylaws or codes of conduct, that may have prevented them from protecting my financial safety ; ( ii ) whether by virtue of Wells Fargos custodianship over my funds or by its control over them, they owed a fiduciary duty to the me and if so, whether that duty was breached ; ( iii ) whether Wells Fargo promoted the transactions in question despite being aware of the nature of the transactions in question ( iv ) whether Wells Fargo was in compliance with its own policies and procedures ; ( v ) whether Wells Fargo owed duties to myself, what the scope of those duties was, and whether Wells Fargo did not uphold those duties ; ( vi ) whether Wells Fargos conduct was unfair ; and ( vii ) whether Wells Fargo has within its power the ability to, and should, compensate me for the harm that has befallen me. 
Upon identification of such unusual or suspicious activity, it is crucial that the relevant staff member adequately describe the factors making an activity or transaction suspicious, thoroughly depict the extent and nature of this activity and properly communicate to the customer that such activity meets the relevant criteria of fraud. 
In providing its services to a customer, a financial institution is required by law to exercise the care and skill of a diligent, prudent organization. In this case, this means that the payment service provider should not turn a XXXX eye to known facts pointing to a real possibility that their customer is being scammed. In other words, Wells Fargo must have had special knowledge of what was occurring or been alerted to a real possibility of fraud taking place. The financial institution must have known or reasonably ought to have known that I was dealing with a scammer. 
Granted, there is room for diversity of view insofar as reasonableness is concerned. Indeed, there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable person involves in its application a subjective element. 
However, it must be remembered that the correct test is always reasonable care in all circumstances, not average care. The fact that most people behave in a certain way may be good evidence that the conduct is reasonable, but this is not necessarily the case. Although reasonableness is a very fluid concept, all of the evidence suggests that Wells Fargo did not foresee the fraud and disregarded even the most obvious dangers in this respect. 
Situations do tend to repeat themselves and it is advisable to examine previous outcomes to see how the standard of the reasonable person should be applied, and that lessons can be learnt from the errors of the past.

Wells Fargos Position : On XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo wrote in a letter We understand that you believe you may be a victim of a fraud scheme resulting in you wiring funds to a third party under false circumstances. We will make every attempt to recall a wire if a victim advises us the transaction was associated with a fraud scheme ; however, we can not guarantee we will able to return the full amount from a suspected fraudulent transaction. If there are insufficient funds in the recipients account or if the recipients account is closed at the time the request to recall a wire is made, we may not be able to recover the funds from the recipients account. 
Refuting Wells Fargos arguments from a purely logical perspective : Wells Fargos position is that the features of the situation at hand do not generate a genuine obligation to protect innocent and helpless victims ; they are essentially arguing that commonsense-based approaches are doomed to fail, leaving their exclusively technical account of the subject matter as the only meaningful choice. For reasons which are unclear, this extremely serious situation barely gets the attention it deserves even though ample evidence has been offered in support of this complaint.

In Wells Fargos view, it is implied that we should not home in ( and consequently rely ) on unwritten laws, practicality, good judgement, reasonableness, sharpness, sensibleness, past outcomes, and insight, when taking appropriate precautions. To underscore, once again, such views are at odds with common sense and are wildly irresponsible.

Imagine a view according to which the one and only thing that can make Wells Fargo morally obligated to do something is having it written down somewhere. Pursuant to this view, if Wells Fargo encounter the suffering of totally naive victims, they are only obligated to intervene in or remedy the situation, to the degree required by written material. This is unbecoming for a reputable establishment such as Wells Fargo. 
I have reviewed the material hereto sent by Wells Fargo carefully, and it unfortunately provides no response to my fundamental argument concerning the degree of care. Given its size, influence, and the resources at its disposal, this establishment clearly had a far greater capacity than an individual such as myself had, to determine the level and likelihood of risk that a client such as myself is subjected to and had a duty to intervene as they now do to query in particular out-of-pattern transactions of this kind. 
It is perfectly obvious that Wells Fargo, inadvertently, employs a subtle approach in addressing some of the key questions in a manner which neither provides me with adequate support nor protects anything other than its own interests. 
It is Wells Fargo here, who has the burden of proof, to show that it has exercised the duty of care, that is to say, that Wells Fargo adhered to a standard of reasonable care in relation to the matter at issue given its extensive experience compared to mine. It is Wells Fargo that claims that the damages which I have suffered in connection to this matter have not been reasonably foreseeable, and that my proposed degree of care is not, and has not been, commensurate with Wells Fargos capacity, experience, expertise, or scope of services in any way. To reemphasize, Wells Fargos indisputable overriding purpose is by no means to purely execute transactions in a XXXX and blank fashion, but rather to strike a balance between executing those transactions and capitalizing on its undeniably vast capabilities to protect consumers thereby enhancing market integrity. 
Apropos of the fluidity of the concept of reasonableness, all Wells Fargo has done in this regard is set up a dichotomy of having or not having the legal obligation under consideration, however, that does not go one-inch toward explaining why various regulatory authorities, such as the XXXX, has maintained that financial institutions can, and should, protect consumers using their systems, advanced technologies, and rich experience. 
Wells Fargo is obliged to take some action if it is sufficiently aware of a real possibility that a fraud may be being perpetuated. If you don't question its customers instructions or raise the possibility of a scam with the customer in these circumstances, it may be liable if the red flags indicate the customer is : particularly vulnerable, or if the possibility of fraud was serious or real, not just suspected. 
There are some recommendations to organisations for protecting customers from financial harm that might occur as a result of fraud or financial abuse ; and gives guidance on how to recognise customers who might be at risk, how to assess the potential risks to the individual and how to take the necessary actions to prevent or minimise financial harm. 
These recommendations are established as a general principle, the organisation should deliver a service that : 1 ) Takes a proactive approach to minimising risks, impact and incidences of financial harm and it sets out systems and tools for the prevention and detection of fraud and financial abuse. As a general point, it says organisations should ensure that all systems are developed using technologies and methodologies that are effective in the prevention of fraud and financial abuse, through authorised and unauthorised payments, thereby minimising the risk of financial harm to customers. As regards to the detection of fraud and financial abuse, it says the organisation : A ) should have measures in place across all payment channels and products to detect suspicious transactions or activities that might indicate fraud or financial abuse. It then lists the following examples of suspicious activity on customer accounts : a. multiple cheque books; b. sudden increased spending ; c. transfers to other accounts ; d. multiple password attempts ; e. logins from new devices, multiple geographical locations ; f. sudden changes to the operation of the account ; Unusual transactions are transactions whose amount, characteristics and frequency bear no relation to the economic activity of the customer, exceed normal market parameters or have no apparent legal justification. 
g. a withdrawal or payment for a large amount ; h. a payment or series of payments to a new payee ; i. financial activity that matches a known method of fraud or financial abuse. 
B ) organisations should have a process in place to ensure that staff make contact with the customer to verify the financial activity, challenge its authenticity, explain the nature of the suspected or detected fraud and discuss an appropriate plan of action. 
Wells Fargo are yet to show, or otherwise provide me with, a compelling argument that their wide-ranging experience and wealth of specialist knowledge in detecting transactional anomalies were not sufficient to avert the fraud at issue. By contrast, I have provided a multitude of sound and powerful reasons by which requiring their involvement has not only been pressingly relevant but also eminently reasonable and well-justified. 
Rather than empathizing with and undertaking substantial efforts to convey their knowledge of the existence of such regulations abroad and thereafter use it to protect and proactively relieve the plight of consumers who have been cheated out of their money and whose role in society is properly fulfilled, positively contributing to local economic growth, development and sustainability Wells Fargo adopts a rather insouciant attitude toward my financial predicament portrayed herein. 
I am deeply convinced that the disastrous results that I have previously elaborated upon will continue to ensue if no responsibility is adopted by Wells Fargo in relation to this matter. I have also thoroughly detailed why they can not simply dismiss this problem by strictly adhering to legal technicalities which, after careful reflection, struck me as being nothing more than selfinterest. Indeed, it seems to me utterly unfair to disregard fragile, sensitive, and vulnerable consumers who are afflicted by such allegedly malevolent acts, thereby keeping an unjust status-quo that is corrupting our society at its core. 
Conclusion : Based on my analysis, and as confirmed by various authorities concerned with such matters, there is abundant evidence that forward-thinking financial institutions ought to take reasonable steps to forestall fraud, or at least mitigate its risk by using an effective risk management system, demonstrating their undisputed ability to responsibly and pre-emptively respond to questionable transactions in the digital arena. The use of such systems, largely based on newly adopted technologies aimed at effectively navigating the evolving threat landscape, is only one of a number of possible endeavours undertaken in this connection, alongside the application of past knowledge and experience related to popular fraudulent practices. 
Astonishingly, I am pondering how it is that, despite being shown that Wells Fargos business conduct was insufficient insofar as background checks are concerned, they keep refuting their indisputable role and responsibility in connection with the matter herein discussed. The points that I have hitherto made are too crucial to be taken lightly. Wells Fargos non-observance of the fundamental principles of justice that is, to completely overlook and not even remotely try to mitigate the suffering of vulnerable consumers is inexcusable given the size of the establishment and the vast resources at its disposal as the direct result of the patronage of clients like myself. 
If it was, indeed, solely my responsibility, we must then believe at least one of the following clauses : a ) financial institutions have absolutely no role whatsoever in preventing and detecting fraud, b ) the fraud in question was not reasonably foreseeable, or c ) the transactions in question were not sufficiently alarming. It is extremely unfortunate that Wells Fargo pushes quite hard for me to believe all three of these thingsdespite evidence to the contrary. 
In summary, I respectively ask your organization to consider my points, given your personal and companywide obligation to provide a fair and reasonable investigation into the complaint. 
I look forward to your input and would gladly cooperate to reach a fair and reasonable outcome.

2021-09-02,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I have been dealing with ongoing identity theft for the past year. A scammer/fraudster was able to pull my credit reports through Credit Karma using my data. The only way I had found out was reviewing my credit report as a result of an alert from credit inquiries. There was a soft inquiry from CreditKarma.com which was odd as I had no prior account with Credit Karma. 

The scammer had created a Credit Karma account online and had already pulled my credit reports using the account. When initially creating a Credit Karma account, you just have to answer simple personal history information. I suspect this scammer used my stolen data or data curated on other freely available network ( ie., XXXX  ). In order for me to deactivate the fraudulent account and create my own account, I had to send in my Driver 's license and bill to verify with Credit Karma. Shouldn't this be reversed, where you send in your data to be verified upon account creation? Credit Karma inappropriately exposes my data to a scammer/fraudster without proper identification. 

Even site such as annualcreditreport.com uses the same method. Since there is no account creation on their site. It is even more difficult to tell if any scammers were able to gain access to my credit report. 

I believe the existing system of using only historical data to verify a person 's identity is highly ineffective and poses a security concern to all consumers.

Account Information : Creditor 's Name : XXXX  XXXX Account Number : XXXX Dates of Late Payments : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Nature of Complaint : On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a dispute to Experian XXXX a late payment reported by XXXX XXXX. I referenced the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S. Code 1681i ) and the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) ( 15 U.S. Code 1637 ( b ) ) in my dispute, explaining that the reported late payment was inaccurate for the following reasons : Payment Date Error : My payments for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were made on time. I have provided bank statements and payment confirmation receipts which clearly show that the payment was processed before the due date, but the creditor erroneously marked it as late. 
Technical System Failure : Upon reviewing my account activity, I identified that there was a technical issue with XXXX  XXXX 's payment processing system during that period. This error delayed the application of my payment, though it was sent on time, as confirmed by the confirmation number I received after submitting the payment. 
Clerical Mistake by the Creditor : In addition, it seems that XXXX XXXX applied my payments to the wrong account, causing a delay in crediting my account on time. I have documentation showing that this mistake was recognized internally by XXXX XXXX  customer service. 
Despite providing this information and adhering to the dispute process within the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Experian has failed to resolve this matter satisfactorily or remove the inaccurate late payment from my credit report. 

As a consumer, I have rights under the FCRA and TILA, including the right to accurate credit reporting. The continued presence of this inaccurate information is negatively impacting my credit score and financial well-being. 

Requested Resolution : I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure that credit reporting agencies adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Truth in Lending Act. 

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to your prompt response regarding the investigation of my complaint.

Privacy Act 1974 he Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of a record about an individual from a system of records absent the written consent of the individual, unless the disclosure is pursuant to one of twelve statutory exceptions. The Act also provides individuals with a means by which to seek access to and amendment of their records, and sets forth various agency record-keeping requirements.

15 USC 6802 and 6805 ( b ) Opt out ( 1 ) In general A financial institution may not disclose nonpublic personal information to a nonaffiliated third party unless ( A ) such financial institution clearly and conspicuously discloses to the consumer, in writing or in electronic form or other form permitted by the regulations prescribed under section 6804 of this title, that such information may be disclosed to such third party ; ( B ) the consumer is given the opportunity, before the time that such information is initially disclosed, to direct that such information not be disclosed to such third party ; and ( C ) the consumer is given an explanation of how the consumer can exercise that nondisclosure option.a ) Privacy obligation policy It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information.

However Experian, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX have continuously reported my information from financial institutions and should be held accountable because I exercised my right to opt-out XX/XX/XXXX.

While I was working I caught him lying about bill amounts, conned me out of money, would go back & change my or our tax returns to go into his bank account. Then refuse me finances or even access to it. After I stopped working because both of our boys are Autistic. Immediately I was refused access to and & all financial statements, cards, accounts, bills & money. On XX/XX/XXXX he notified me that the next day that we needed to go see a Bankruptcy XXXX.

That with his pay, he shouldn't ever be in debt & that he damaged all of it with over spending, not paying loans or credit cards back.

The lack of communication and resolution from your team has left me deeply frustrated and concerned about the safety of my funds and personal information. 

Since the restriction was placed on my account, I have repeatedly attempted to contact your support team to resolve the issue. However, I have been met with the following obstacles : 1. Lack of Communication : I receive automated messages in the Robinhood app instructing me to call customer support. Despite following these instructions, I am placed in long call queues for hours, only to be disconnected without assistance.

2. Ineffective Case Numbers : Your team has provided case numbers that do not work when entered into your system, rendering them useless for tracking or resolving my issue. 
3. Repeated Identity Verification Requests : I have been asked several times to provide proof of my identity, which I have done promptly and accurately. Despite this, the issue remains unresolved. 

These actions ( or lack thereof ) have caused me significant stress, as I now fear for the security of both my funds and my personal information.

This account has not been listed on any of the 3 credit bureaus in over 17 years. I went to pay another Capital One account that is in good standings and my bank never removed this account ending in XXXX from the list of creditors I pay by phone. 

In XX/XX/XXXX. I accidently made a {$190.00} payment to what I thought was the active Capital One account. The payment went to this closed account. I called Capital One and told them this account was in bankruptcy and to return the money. They would not return the money. The Capital One representative told me that she would turn this dispute over to the Capital one attorneys and get back to me in 10 days. She never did and I never received a call from the attorneys. 

Next month for the first time in 17 years I received a statement from Capital One for payment on account ending in XXXX. They took the {$190.00} payment.

Backdated those payments and spread that {$190.00} payment from XX/XX/XXXX back to XXXX to XXXX to make it seem like I have been paying all along which I have not done. Then they reported this account as charge off. 

I pay all my bills on time. My credit score was XXXX. Now because of Capital One AND ONLY Capital one my credit score is XXXX. All the credit card have with good rates have now increased the interest rate to 29.99 % Because of this charge off.

3 ) Fraudulently not showing the {$190.00} payment made in XX/XX/XXXX but deceiving me by sending me a statement with small monthly payments backdated and spread out over 10 months to make me think I was paying all along.

Despite multiple dispute attempts the CRA 's continue to incorrectly report inaccurate and misleading information to my consumer report, specifically the listed charged-off account ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. The account was CLOSED XX/XX/XXXX and is actively reporting "" last activity '' of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

This information is in direct violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and is adversely affecting my credit profile. The continued reporting of this account as charged off with a remaining balance is not only inaccurate but also misleading. The Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) clearly defines a charged-off account as XXXX with no remaining balance, in addition too, becoming TAXABLE INCOME to the consumer. To which I have never received any XXXX. The CRA 's action in reporting this account with a balance constitutes a violation of the FCRA by providing false, misleading, and unverifiable information. 

Furthermore, the inclusion of these accounts on my credit report without my explicit consent is a clear violation of my privacy rights. The FCRA mandates that consumer reporting agencies, such as ( XXXX, Experian, XXXX ) have a duty to protect consumer information and ensure its accuracy. The CRAs actions in this matter represent a blatant disregard for these regulations. By reporting inaccurate and misleading information about me, the CRA 's have caused significant harm to my credit standing, limiting my access to credit and financial opportunities. This is a direct result of their ( XXXX, Experian, XXXX ) negligence and failure to adhere to the FCRA. I demand the immediate deletion of the aforementioned charged-off account from my credit report. 

Additionally, I reserve the right to pursue all available legal remedies, including but not limited to monetary damages, for the harm caused by the CRAs violations of the FCRA. I have attached a copy of my credit report for your reference. I expect a timely response to this dispute, including written confirmation of the accounts deletion from my credit report. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Dont get close to your credit limit. Credit scoring models look at how close you are to being maxed out, so try to keep your balances low compared to your total credit limit. If you close some credit card accounts and put most or all of your credit card balances onto one card, it may hurt your credit score if this means that you are using a high percentage of your total credit limit. Experts advise keeping your use of credit at no more than 30 percent of your total credit limit. You dont need to revolve on credit cards to get a good score. Paying off the balance each month helps get you the best scores. '' I follow all of this..please help me and others from being victims of these reporting agencies",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",MD,217XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2020-08-18,Closed with explanation,Yes,,3801103

2023-10-24,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Below is the exact dispute I submitted to Hyundai Motor Finance with personal information removed. 

Dear Hyundai Credit Department, I am writing you to file a dispute against the current historical record of my account related to a XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. The account number is question is ( removed ). This vehicle was in a collision and totaled in XXXX of XXXX. I took the proper steps in filing an insurance claim and having them choose to Total Loss the vehicle. They provided a check to your company which remained un-deposited by your team until it was voided a year later. No one from Hyundai Finance reached out directly to me or the insurance company regarding any issues with the payoff. To the contrary, when I received a bill the following month, I contacted Hyundai Motor Finance for clarification. I was told the check was received and that my account was paid in full. 
Fast forward 15 months and I see that my credit score has plummeted. When I began to investigate this issue I found that Hyundai Motor Finance had never closed my account and was reporting that I was no longer making payments to the credit reporting companies. I filed multiple disputed through XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX providing documentation that I had done correctly on my end and that Hyundai Motor Finance was at fault. I contacted my insurance company and they were able to send a 2nd check which was deposited on XXXXXXXX 
As is stands now, the disputes I started were completed and nothing was done to rectify and correct the history of payments your company falsely reported. It is as if the information I provided did nothing. I am filing this direct dispute in an attempt to have my record corrected and prove that I am not responsible for the current history of Charge-Offs and Late Payments Hyundai Motor Finance has been reporting for the previous 16 months. 
Inclosed you will find the following documentation. 
-A letter from Hyundai Motor Finance I received on XXXX  stating that the final payment on the account was received on XXXX and that the account has been closed. 
-An e-mail from the insurance company stating the check was mailed and never cashed. This email is from when I first found out about the issue at hand. 
-A draft copy of the original check submitted and emailed to Hyundai Motor Finance XXXX including payoff amount, date posted, date of claim, and Hyundai Account Number. There is also a request for contact if there are any issues with the draft. 
-Email including claim number and insurance adjuster information for vehicle and account in question. 
XXXXA copy of the vehicles title which was sent to XXXX XXXX and signed and dated on XXXXXXXX  by an Authorized Hyundai Motor Finance Agent. 
-A partial print out of my payment records from the months leading up to the collision. It shows that our payments were set to auto-draft 2 day before the payment is due. The last payment applied shows XXXXXXXX  followed by a Refund on XXXX of {$560.00}. There is also a {$0.00} principal balance shown for the same month. As auto draft was set up any pending payment would automatically be submitted and should have never missed to begin with. 

Information that is not included but I have verified through multiple conversations with Hyundai Motor Finance XXXXA 2nd title was sent to XXXX XXXX after the 2nd check was received and deposited. 
When calling Hyundai Motor Finance it claims my account is paid in full. This has always been the case but now includes that it was closed as of XXXXXXXX 
I am unable to access my account online to print my account history. 

-As of XXXX Hyundai Capital America was court ordered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, under filling number XXXX, to pay {$19.00} XXXX XXXX in settlements for knowingly furnishing inaccurate and negative information to credit companies between the years XXXX. While this issue falls outside the years stated in the filling it does bring into question the possibility of continual poor business practices that may or may not have been corrected. 

I am requesting that ALL negative associations filed against my account be completely wiped from its history and that the account, going forward, will remain paid in full with no missed or late payments. It currently states Paid in Full, Charged Off. As this was no fault of my own, I want it removed. If there are any questions fill free to contact me directly at any time as no information has been provided or is available that would allow me to contact you over the phone. 
Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXXUPDATE* Above is the original dispute filing. This dispute was printed and mailed on XX/XX/XXXX by certified mail. After contacting USPS informed that the package was delivered and signed for on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  I waited the allowed month for the dispute to be resolved including an additional week to allow for return shipping. When I had received no contact as of XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out by phone for answers. I was able to speak to a lady by the name of XXXX XXXX. I informed her of the situation and she was able to provide me with an update. Hyundai Motor Finance received the dispute on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  and had made notations on XX/XX/XXXX that the account should be corrected. 

As of the phone call on XX/XX/XXXX, no corrections had been mad. She then proceeded to file another internal dispute on the backend of there system. Admitting the error was Hyundai Motor Finances fault that a backend report should sort things out. 
XXXX emailed me a letter ( included as a separate file ) that the account will reflect the paid in full date to effectively be changed to XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  I waited another month and still no changes. I reached out on XX/XX/XXXX for answers. I was informed since I had called on XX/XX/XXXX that they are allowed another 30 days to resolve the dispute. 

Over the course of this process, I had at multiple times requested a call back from a supervisor. I never received one. As of this update, XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX no corrections to my account have been made nor have I spoken to anyone in higher management.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,HYUNDAI CAPITAL AMERICA,AL,363XX,,Consent provided,Web,2023-10-24,Closed with explanation,Yes,,7743242

On XX/XX/2023, I submitted a dispute to Experian regarding a late payment entry on my credit report. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I have the right to request a proper investigation into any disputed information on my credit report. 
However, I am deeply disappointed to inform you that the investigation carried out by Experian did not meet the required standards for accuracy and thoroughness. The investigation failed to consider all relevant information and did not address the concerns I raised in my dispute. 
As a consumer, it is my right to have accurate and fair information reflected in my credit report. I believe that Experian 's failure to properly investigate my dispute constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA. 
I kindly request that Experian promptly rectifies this situation by conducting a comprehensive investigation into the disputed late payment entry on my credit report. I expect that all necessary measures will be taken to ensure a thorough examination of the facts and a fair resolution. 
Please provide me with a written response within 30 days from the date of this notice, confirming the initiation of a proper investigation into my dispute. Additionally, I request that any negative information related to the disputed late payment entry be temporarily removed from my credit report until a thorough investigation is completed. 
Failure to address this matter within the stipulated time frame may result in my pursuit of legal remedies available under the FCRA and any other applicable laws.

2023-08-04,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I want to put in this complaint in for the last time. We live in a country where its citizens are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. That holds true everywhere except for credit. We are not told that something is being placed in our report. We are not given time to defend ourselves about the information. It is thrown on our report and then we have to spend our time trying to prove the information is not ours, or inaccurate, even if it ours it changes from agency to another. I have been A XXXX for 25 years. I have borrowed and paid back tens of millions of dollars. In this country, you are defined by a number. The problem with that is that you have three credit Bureau agencies who have no customer to satisfy. They continue to skirt their obligations of accuracy and their due diligence to make sure what they are reporting is in fact correct. I will prove this with the information that I'm about to give and upload to you. According to the according to the fair Credit Act, Over the past year, I have filed a dispute on a numerous error, and asked for documented verification of certain items. Only to be sent letters to say verified. I have sent on 4 different times to disputes with XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Experian with not much success. The success of my business depends on my ability to borrow, which has been devastated these past 5 years. I have XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I can not even get a mortgage for me at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I recently filed a complaint through CFPB only to have the same thing happen. I am asking for the CFPB to look over my evidence. This time I am using the 3 reports against each other. You will see inconsistencies from agency to agency in the same report. You will see inconsistencies in their report. How is it that one agency is able to get information about when a last payment was made, but the other agency can't report it because they don't know it. Balances that are different from agency to agency. Dates that are inconsistent from agency to agency. Past due amounts that are inconsistent from agency to agency. When the last time there was a update reported inconsistent from agency to agency. And even agencies report that say something was paid on this date but then you look in their history graph and it shows something completely different. What's more amazing is that they've had five opportunities to get this information correct and as of XX/XX/2023, I pulled all three from the annual credit site. And found again numerous data that didn't match from one agency to the other. How do you know what is correct if one agency says your balance is this and another agency says it's this. Doesn't this prove that out of five times they're not doing their job, but my livelihood is tied to people who it appears has no desire or ability to get inf0rmation correct. So, I am coming to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to beg for protection. The Fair Credit Act also states that if there is an inkling of inaccurate information it must be removed. When you have these agencies reporting on the same company yet, the information is not consistent, then how do you know if any of it is true? I am begging for your help to look at what I'm sending. And force them to remove these items from my credit. So that might get my life back. Most of Americans don't have the ability to sue them directly. That's why we need you. To be our hammer and hold them accountable. Five times this past year, they had claimed verified. But as you will see they're still inconsistent information so somebody's lying. The problem is we don't know which one therefore it needs to be removed permanently. I would appreciate your help in this matter.

2015-07-24,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Personal information,"I have spent long periods working overseas and my credit file is essentially empty. There is nothing negative in my credit file. Now that I have returned to the US I went to a bank to open an account, a credit card, and to inquire about a mortgage. When the bank accessed my TransUnion credit report, another person 's name and addresses came up. That person 's name is XXXX XXXX, of XXXX, Michigan. I have never used that name and have never been to XXXX Michigan. 

There is also credit information in the report that does not belong to me. I 'm assuming that just XXXX loan was mis-entered so that my ssn became associated with this other person 's name and address. So although the credit information is not negative, it has taken my identity and made it impossible to proceed in establishing and using credit. 

When I opened a retirement account through my new employer, security questions such as "" With which of these addresses have you been associated '' were matched to addresses in towns where I have never lived. I moved on to other questions that actually pertained to me, but there were more questions that were relevant to this other individual than there were that were relevant to me. 

I reported this to TransUnion XXXX, once on the XXXX of XXXX, and once around the middle of the month. To my knowledge they have taken no steps to resolve this matter. My entire life is on hold until they resolve this matter. 

Given the enormous responsibility of credit reporting agencies, such as TransUnion, I expect communication and proactivity when they are presented with such a claim. If they can not quickly resolve mistakes of their making, they should not be allowed to play such an important role in the lives of consumers. Resolving this quickly is the most important item on my "" master '' to-do list, and I ask for your help.

They, the home equity line of credit division, told me that my house had lost equity. Therefor they had to freeze my loan. I got comps showing that my house had increased in equity. Then they said that my credit report was not good. I got copies. They admitted to me and to XXXX, loan officer at Bank of America, XXXX XXXX, California, that my credit was good. And it is. Then I received a notice saying that I had material changes in my financial circumstances and they would have to freeze the loan. This, freezing my loan, took place in XXXX, XXXX and has continued since. 
I asked to see a signed copy of my contract. They do not have one. They have stalled on this now for nine months. I had insurance should I not be able to pay my loan. They said I had cancelled it. I asked for a signed copy of such a cancellation. They do n't have one of course. 
They have also claimed that they had to freeze my loan because of liens. Those liens were on my home since XXXX, well before I established the line of credit. 
I have continued making payments, have asked for proof. Every conversation I have with them tells me that they intend to take my house and they will listen to nothing. Here 's the thing : The comps say that my house is valued at {$230.00}, I currently owe only {$22000.00}. My realtor, as I have my house up for sale, represents bank of America with foreclosures in my area. She claims she has seen B of A do this same scam with others. 
So ... I had arranged to leave the last {$3000.00} untouched and use for payments. The bank has put unnatural pressure on me by freezing my loan. 
So what happened next.? First they charge me late fees when there are n't any. ( I have made sure XXXX XXXX B of A monitors all my payments now. ) They have raised the amount of pay back to XXXX rather than XXXX or 31 days three months in a row. XXXX has practically yelled at them over the phone telling them they ca n't do that. XXXX XXXX used to work in B o A loan department. ) An employee in the department confided to me that they should n't be doing this to me. Her name is XXXX. XXXX I had a recording. XXXX, XXXX of B o A XXXX XXXX fought for me. Just retired. He thought what they were doing was ridiculous. 
Next I get a letter from B of A saying that my loan expires on XXXX, XXXX and I will either have to pay back loan in full or I will be paying much larger payments per month. This last loan began in XXXX. And already I have to pay it back in large sums.

After a few hours and into the next day, the money I paid to Affrim for the tickets still hadn't been refunded to me. I immediately contacted Affrim to let them know about the situation. I provided Affrim with a copy of the email I received from XXXX confirming that we're unable to complete my purchase and a copy of the canceled purchase from XXXX '' website. I was told that the transaction was still processing, and I had to wait until it was processed to receive my refund. It has now been over a month, and I've contacted Affirm about his several times over the last month. Each time I spoke with, I was assured someone was working on it, and within 3-5 business days, I should have a resolution. They stated they needed to contact the merchant, and if the merchant didn't respond by XX/XX/2002, they would move ahead in processing my claim. That never happened, so I followed up # times since, and each time I was told it would escalate to the highest level of dispute, someone would contact me. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a form/generic email asking me to submit documents I had previously submitted three weeks ago, and it would be another 15 days. That time has come and gone, and now they are telling me they are submitting to the merchant again asked me for the same documents and will sub it to the same dispute resolution departmeent ( which is the highest level again ), essentially restating the entire process Again!! This is 100 % theft and fraud at this point. They are fully aware that I was not provided a product or service in relation to the proposed loan yet have still refused to return my money.",,"Affirm Holdings, Inc",MD,21093,,Consent provided,Web,2022-07-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,,5787726
